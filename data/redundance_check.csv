Eyewitnesses said the bus driver did not notice the incoming train leading to the gory accident.  It all happened in no time.  Even before we realised what had happened it was all over.  Pieces of flesh and blood were strewn all around.  The bus was mangled beyond recognition.  It was a very sad sight a teacher who was present at the accident spot told mediapersons.  A mother who lost her child in the terrible tragedy said the bus left her house only 10 minutes earlier.  It was the last goodbye by my child she said amidst tears while recalling the tata waving of hand as a gesture of goodbye of her son.

Villagers alleged that they had brought to the notice of railway officials the need for a railway gate to avoid accidents.  They alleged that several accidents had occurred at the spot in the past.  The impact of the collision was so severe that the train dragged the bus for about a kilometre.  Villagers blame railway authorities for the mishap but grieving parents found fault with the bus driver for overspeeding and negligence while crossing the railway track.  Eyewitnesses said the bus driver did not notice the incoming train leading to the gory accident.  It all happened in no time.  Even before we realised what had happened it was all over.  Pieces of flesh and blood were strewn all around.  The bus was mangled beyond recognition.  It was a very sad sight a teacher who was present at the accident spot told mediapersons.  A mother who lost her child in the terrible tragedy said the bus left her house only 10 minutes earlier.  It was the last goodbye by my child she said amidst tears while recalling the tata waving of hand as a gesture of goodbye of her son.  Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao Andhra Pradeshs chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and YSRCP leader YS Jaganmohan Reddy expressed shock over the incident.  A probe has been ordered.  Union railway minister Sadananda Gowda too expressed grief over the loss of lives.  South Central Railway CPRO K Samba Siva Rao said that 26 people including 25 students and the bus driver were reported dead in the accident and the death toll might increase as several more students suffered injuries.  Immediately after the incident we dispatched relief vehicles from Secunderabad and Hyderabad.  All our senior officials have reached the place and our general manager is also going there to personally supervise the relief work the CPRO said.  The injured students were rushed to various hospitals in Toopran town. ,TRANSPORT_HAZARDS,1

We are expecting quite wide impacts from CYCLONE Emma when she arrives [TIME-ARG] tomorrow night [TIME-ARG],So far the north and east of the country have borne the brunt of the snow but now the arrival of CYCLONE Emma will bring the white stuff to millions more of us on [TIME-ARG] Friday [TIME-ARG], UK braced for CYCLONE Emma as heavy snow causes chaos. content:London February 28 A brutal winter blast named Beast from the East after the direction of the winds is set to transform into CYCLONE Emma as the UK suffers severe travel disruptions and chaos due to heavy snow.  The Meteorological Office issued a rare red warning which indicates danger to life in Scotland after a second day of heavy snow today.  Several trains and flights have faced cancellations and delays since the start of this week as airports around the country suspend operations to clear the snow from runways.  “We are expecting quite wide impacts from CYCLONE Emma when she arrives tomorrow night.  We are forecasting more snow strong winds and freezing rain which will make driving conditions extremely dangerous” a Met Office spokesperson said.  Amber warnings calling for people to be wary are in place in northern and eastern England and the East Midlands with a number of police forces warning against driving because of poor visibility and treacherous conditions leading to crashes and stranded motorists.  Four people are believed to have died in road crashes directly linked to the severe weather conditions across Britain.  “The Beast from the East will tighten its grip as the week goes on.  Gale-force winds and super-cooled freezing rain could turn parts of the UK into an ice rink by the weekend” said Sara Thornton director of digital weather service Weathertrending.  “So far the north and east of the country have borne the brunt of the snow but now the arrival of CYCLONE Emma will bring the white stuff to millions more of us on Friday.  Gales will come with the snow bringing blizzard conditions to some southern and western parts of the UK that have so far been spared the snow” she said.  The snow has forced the closure of hundreds of schools across the UK after overnight temperatures dropped to almost -12 degrees Celsius in some areas.  There are fears that some rural communities could be cut off as power cuts and mobile phone network interruptions are expected.  The army has been drafted into Lincolnshire to help emergency services who have stepped up their official response to “critical”.  There are fears that one of this winters longest big freezes in the UK could result in the highest death toll for 20 years. — PTI. ,STORM,1

Some detainees had set fire to mattresses in one part of the centre “and as a result the blaze started” he said.  Thirty other detainees were hurt and were taken to hospital emergency officials and local media said.  Some were seen being carried to ambulances and municipal vans.

It was not immediately known how many young offenders were in the Juvenile Diagnosis and Rehabilitation Centre in Trujillo located 500 kilometres north of the capital Lima.  A couple of years ago the establishments director complained that although the facility was built to hold 80 minors it had more than twice that crowded inside.  Peruvian television showed images of relatives gathered outside the centre anxious for news of what was happening inside.  “Please we want to know the truth.  There are people dead they arent at the hospital.  My son is inside” the mother of one detainee sobbed in a video posted by the newspaper Correo.  Columns of smoke were seen rising from the site and it was reported fire crews had brought the flames under control after a three-hour operation.

We have seen at least 38 people dead said Abdukadir Abdurahman Aden of the Aamin Ambulance of the bombings that targeted the presidential palace and a hotel.

The Shabaab Islamist militant group claimed the attacks in a statement posted online saying it was targeting the government and security services.

The security forces foiled the intent of the terrorists.  They were aiming for key targets but they could not even go closer there were five of them killed by the security force said Abdulahi Ahmed a security officer.

In the wake of that attack Somalias government declared a fresh offensive against the group and US drone strikes have increased in frequency.  While the militant group was pushed out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force it continues to control large parts of the countryside and launches regular attacks on government military and civilian targets. ,TERRORIST_ATTACK,0

The shoot-out erupted when police hunted down the armed gang that is alleged to have CYCLONEed a police station in Eastern Cape province and killed five officers and a retired soldier on Wednesday.  The group which uses a church as a hiding place was cornered inside the church premises the Hawks police investigative unit said in a statement.  A gun battle between suspects and police ensued which left seven suspects dead and a task force member injured in the legs.  It added that 10 other suspects were arrested while some escaped the scene near Ngcobo the town where the policemen were killed.  Local media said the shoot-out had occurred outside the Mancoba Seven Angels Ministries church in Nyanga village.  The gang had stolen weapons from the police station.  Attacks on police are common in South Africa but the killing of five officers provoked national outrage.  In the past people would just accept it and move on but this time they are saying no President Cyril Ramaphosa who took office last week said.  We want answers and we want arrests.  When there is a disaster like this it should be attended to with maximum speed.  At least 57 South African police officers were killed in the line of duty between April 2016 and March 2017 according to the latest crime statistics. ,TERRORIST_ATTACK,0

BEIJING: China on Wednesday said a 6.9-magnitude. earthquake in Tibet in mid-November had caused turbidity in the Brahmaputra waters which had sparked concerns in India.Chinese. foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying also said the recent tests showed that the water quality met the standards of Class III water.  Class III is generally regarded as good for fish regeneration and wildlife.  Earlier media reports spoke of heavy pollution in the Brahmaputra river known as Siang river in Arunachal Pradesh.  Some media outlets quoted reports of formation of barrier lakes in Tibet close to Arunachal Pradesh which has sparked concerns of a possible deluge in the downstream.  We have noted that Indian media recently made a series of reports on this issue.  They said China was conducting water conservancy project or exploiting a mine previously whereas now claim there is a barrier lake upstream Hua said.  I could tell you responsibly that none of these speculations is true according to the results of the investigation by the relevant Chinese authorities she told PTI in response to a question.  She said the 6.9-magnitude. earthquake in mid-November hit the area near Mainling County in Tibet which might have lead to the turbidity in the middle and lower reaches of the river for a certain period of time.

At the same time she stressed that the investigation done by China is utterly for humanitarian considerations and does not affect its stance on the border issue.  China claims Arunachal Pradesh as Southern Tibet.  Hua yesterday said that China will maintain communication with India to deal with massive lakes formed by on the following the earthquake which caused concerns of a sudden flooding on the Indian side.  She said verification by the relevant Chinese authorities revealed that the lake is to the eastern section of the India-China boundary.  It is caused by natural factors.  It is not a manmade accident.  I noticed that Indian professional authorise have made an analysis and clarified she said referring to reports that the lakes were formed by the landslides.

The nearly [TIME-ARG] 30hourlong [TIME-ARG]  gunfight in Srinagar city ended today with the killing of two holed up militants,The nearly 30hourlong gunfight in Srinagar city ended [TIME-ARG] today [TIME-ARG]  with the killing of two holed up militants, Srinagar gunfight ends 2 Lashkar men killed.  The nearly 30-hour-long gunfight in Srinagar city ended today with the killing of two holed up militants.  The two militants were hiding in an under-construction multi-storey building at Karan Nagar after they failed to attack a Central Reserve Police Force CRPF camp in the wee hours on Monday.  The government had imposed restrictions in the old city to avoid any law and order situation during the anti-militancy operation.  “The encounter concluded this afternoon.  In the operation two terrorists were killed.  Their identity is being ascertained.  The incriminating material we recovered from them suggests they were from the Lashkar-e-Toiba” Inspector General of Police Kashmir Swayam Prakash Pani said.  During the encounter one CRPF man was killed and one policeman suffered bullet injuries but his condition is stable.  The IGP said the operation was carried out in the congested locality and a lot of civilian population was around.  “While the operation was planned immediately the civilian population was moved from the area and we thank the citizens of Srinagar city for cooperating with us.  Because of the help of the community we could take out the residents from the encounter site.  Subsequently a deliberate assault line was planned by the CRPF and Special Operation Group of the J&K Police.  There was no collateral damage during the operation” he said.  Sources privy to the operation said the highly-trained militants were shifting from one room to another and that prolonged the operation.  “We fired a number of rockets to break the walls of the building.  Once we were successful in it the militant movement was restricted and they took position on the ground floor.  At 11 am we were able to neutralise the first militant” a security official said.  The exchange of fire continued and another militant was injured.  “At around 1 am the final assault was launched inside the building and the second militant was killed an hour later” he said.  Two AK-47 rifles eight AK-47 magazines and other war-like stores were recovered from the encounter site.  A possible fidayeen attack was foiled on Monday when an alert sentry at Karan Nagar noticed two militants armed with AK-47s and rucksacks approaching the CRPF Battalion Headquarters at Karan Nagar.  The sentry opened fire and the militants fled from the spot and took shelter in a partially constructed multi-storey building in the area.

Four dead as CYCLONE hits [PLACE-ARG] southern Philippines [PLACE-ARG],Four dead as CYCLONE hits [PLACE-ARG] southern Philippines [PLACE-ARG], Four dead as CYCLONE hits southern Philippines.  Manila February 13 Four people were killed in the southern Philippines on Tuesday as a tropical CYCLONE unleashed heavy rain and triggered deadly landslides police said.  Tropical CYCLONE Sanba slammed the east coast of the main southern island of Mindanao Tuesday with gusts of 75 kilometres an hour.  The heavy rain triggered landslides that hit mountain villages outside the mining town of Carrascal — 760 kilometres south of the capital Manila — killing four people municipal police chief James Alendogao told AFP.  These areas are currently inaccessible and we do not know the extent of the damage he added.  The state weather service said the CYCLONE was expected to move swiftly northwest over the next 24 hours bringing moderate to heavy rain across the central Philippines.  The archipelago nation is struck by 20 CYCLONEs or typhoons each year on average some of them deadly.  Sanba is already the second major system to hit this year and the first to cause casualties.  Tropical CYCLONE Tembin killed 240 people in the Mindanao region in December last year.  The countrys deadliest on record is Super Typhoon Haiyan which left more than 7350 people dead or missing across the central Philippines in November 2013 — AFP. ,STORM,1

Nukualofa: Tonga declared a state of emergency on Monday as a powerful cyclone bears down on the Pacific island nation after wreaking havoc in neighbouring Samoa.  Acting Prime Minister Semisi Sika issued the nationwide alert saying he was satisfied that an emergency is happening or is about to happen in the kingdom.  Severe Tropical Cyclone Gita is intensifying as it approaches and the Fiji Meteorological Service predicted it will become a maximum category five CYCLONE before reaching Tonga on Monday night.  It is already packing wind gusts of 220 kmh 137 mph as it gathers strength some 370 kilometres east of Tongas most populous island Tongatapu.  Tongas Fuaamotu Weather Forecasting Centre warned residents could expect very destructive hurricane force winds.  Gita slammed into Samoa overnight Friday forcing the evacuation of some 200 people and causing widespread flooding leaving many without power and electricity.  Tongas information ministry said evacuation centres were being prepared across the kingdom and advised residents to avoid unnecessary travel.  Every family should have an emergency kit packed in their homes it said.  Everyone should be mindful of what might cause damage within their homes such as large trees that can potentially damage a house.  Cyclones are common in the Pacific at this time of year with top-of-the-scale category five systems proving highly destructive when they make landfall.  Cyclone Winston killed 44 people in Fiji in 2016 and Cyclone Pam claimed 11 lives and damaged 65000 homes in Vanuatu in 2015,STORM,1

Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes earlier said all 19 of the people then confirmed dead were civilians.  “Three of them died from smoke inhalation and 16 burned to death in their cars when they found themselves trapped by flames on the road from Figueiro dos Vinhos to Castanheira de Pera” Gomes told journalists.  Fourteen civilians were injured 10 of them seriously along with six firefighters he added.  The flames spread “with great violence” moving out on four fronts he said.  Several villages were affected by the blaze but Gomes was not immediately able to comment on the extent of the damage caused.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Taliban was quick to deny involvement in the assault near the Afghan Voice Agency a media outlet which earlier reports had suggested could have been the target.  Deputy interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said the blasts were in fact aimed at the Shiite Tabayan cultural centre.  A ceremony was being held to mark the 38th anniversary of Soviet invasion in Afghanistan when the explosion went off he said.  We have 40 killed 30 wounded but this is not the final toll.  It might go up he added.  Rahimi said the main blast was followed by two smaller bomb explosions that did not cause casualties.

CUTTACK: A three-storey garment store in the busy Palamandap locality of the city was completely gutted in a blazing fire which also reduced three nearby shops to ashes on Sunday.  No loss of life was reported in the mishap nor was any one injured.  The store had no fire safety equipment in place said fire fighters.  At around 11.25 am some of the customers in the store noticed a fire - caused reportedly due to a short circuit - and alerted its staff.  Salespersons and customers were immediately guided out of the showroom.  People also vacated the nearby buildings as soon as word spread of the fire.  The fire was so severe that 21 fire tenders and 160 personnel had to be pressed into action to douse the flames in an operation that lasted for more than five hours.  Locals have claimed that property worth crores was gutted in the fire.  I was standing near the store when heavy smoke began billowing out.  Within minutes the entire three-storey store was engulfed in flames.  The fire spread to the two other shops located in the neighbouring building said Srikant Das an eye-witness.  Das said there were very few customers in the store as it had just opened.  On January 4 a fire had broken out at a similar early hour in a shopping mall at Damana in Bhubaneswar.  With the stretch leading up to the store encroached upon by shops fire tenders had a tough time reaching the site.  Firemen also struggled to control the flames on Sunday as the garment store was filled with inflammable materials and had no fire safety equipment in place.  The store had no fire safety licence which is mandatory.  The store is over 100 feet high but the breadth of the staircase was only 1.5 feet.  Our men had to demolish walls and use hydraulic stairs to enter the structure and put out the flames said chief fire officer Sukant Sethi.  An electricity transformer is located outside the showroom - a fact that had triggered panic among many who were watching the scene from the roads.  Luckily firemen controlled the flames before they reached the transformer otherwise the results would have been disastrous said Laxman Agarwal another eye-witness.  Vehicular movement on the stretch from Badambadi to Link Road was affected for hours after the mishap.  Director general of fire services B K Sharma has ordered an inquiry into the incident to find out the exact cause behind the problem. ,FIRE,0

With the stretch leading up to the store encroached upon by shops fire tenders had a tough time reaching the site.  Firemen also struggled to control the flames on Sunday as the garment store was filled with inflammable materials and had no fire safety equipment in place.  The store had no fire safety licence which is mandatory.  The store is over 100 feet high but the breadth of the staircase was only 1.5 feet.  Our men had to demolish walls and use hydraulic stairs to enter the structure and put out the flames said chief fire officer Sukant Sethi.  An electricity transformer is located outside the showroom - a fact that had triggered panic among many who were watching the scene from the roads.  Luckily firemen controlled the flames before they reached the transformer otherwise the results would have been disastrous said Laxman Agarwal another eye-witness.  Vehicular movement on the stretch from Badambadi to Link Road was affected for hours after the mishap.  Director general of fire services B K Sharma has ordered an inquiry into the incident to find out the exact cause behind the problem. ,FIRE,0

50 dead in suicide bomb attack at [PLACE-ARG] Nigeria mosque [PLACE-ARG],Kano A suicide bomber has killed at least 50 people at a [PLACE-ARG] mosque in the northeastern Nigerian town of Mubi [PLACE-ARG]  police say, 50 dead in suicide bomb attack at Nigeria mosque.  Kano: A suicide bomber has killed at least 50 people at a mosque in the north-eastern Nigerian town of Mubi police say.  The teenage bomber detonated his explosives early on Tuesday in Adamawa state as people were arriving for morning prayers.  Police spokesman Othman Abubakar said that the young man was mingling among the worshippers.  Ahmed Musa chairman of Mubi council said dozens of people had been injured.  Police were still trying to ascertain the number of injured because they are in various hospitals Mr Abubakar said.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the attack bears the hallmark of Boko Haram which typically mounts suicide attacks in crowded public places such as mosques and markets.  Tuesdays attack is the highest loss of life since 18 people were killed in neighbouring Borno state in September.  Boko Haram has waged an insurgency in north-east Nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an Islamic state in the region killing more than 20000 and forcing about 2 million people to flee their homes.  Most attacks by the group focus on Borno state the birthplace of the insurgency.  The group held a swathe of land around the size of Belgium in Borno Adamawa and Yobe states until early 2015 but were forced out by Nigerias army backed by troops from neighbouring countries. ,TERRORIST_ATTACK,1

JAKARTA: A strong earthquake shook Indonesias densely populated Java island on Friday night killing two people and severely damaging dozens of homes near the epicenter.  The magnitude 6.5 quake struck at 11:47pm on Friday and was felt across the island including about 200 kilometers 124 miles away in the capital Jakarta where office towers and apartment buildings swayed.  Powerful tremors lasted as much as 30 seconds in places.  Panicking people ran out of buildings in many areas and roads were clogged with motorbikes cars and trucks as people fled coastal areas in fear of a tsunami.  Ahmad Solihin a food vendor in a coastal area of the Sukabumi region said his village was jolted by a 20-second tremor that cracked walls in his home.  He fled on his motorbike with his wife and two children after neighbors shouted that water was coming he said.  People suddenly started running so I joined them said Solihin.  More than 1000 villagers in his area evacuated to higher ground and didnt return until Saturday morning after authorities convinced them it was safe he said.  A 62-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman were killed in building collapses said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.  Damage was heaviest in the Tasikmalaya Pangandaran and Ciamis regions of West Java Province near the epicenter.  More than 40 houses collapsed and about 65 suffered severe damage said Nugroho.  The earthquake was about 91 kilometers 56 miles deep and located just inland the US Geological Survey said.  It triggered a tsunami warning for parts of Javas coastline that was lifted about two hours later.  No significant waves were reported.  Several hospitals were damaged by the shaking and patients evacuated.  Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. ,EARTHQUAKE,1

JAKARTA: A strong earthquake shook Indonesias densely populated Java island on Friday night killing two people and severely damaging dozens of homes near the epicenter.  The magnitude 6.5 quake struck at 11:47pm on Friday and was felt across the island including about 200 kilometers 124 miles away in the capital Jakarta where office towers and apartment buildings swayed.  Powerful tremors lasted as much as 30 seconds in places.  Panicking people ran out of buildings in many areas and roads were clogged with motorbikes cars and trucks as people fled coastal areas in fear of a tsunami.  Ahmad Solihin a food vendor in a coastal area of the Sukabumi region said his village was jolted by a 20-second tremor that cracked walls in his home.  He fled on his motorbike with his wife and two children after neighbors shouted that water was coming he said.  People suddenly started running so I joined them said Solihin.  More than 1000 villagers in his area evacuated to higher ground and didnt return until Saturday morning after authorities convinced them it was safe he said.

The earthquake was about 91 kilometers 56 miles deep and located just inland the US Geological Survey said.  It triggered a tsunami warning for parts of Javas coastline that was lifted about two hours later.  No significant waves were reported.  Several hospitals were damaged by the shaking and patients evacuated.  Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. ,EARTHQUAKE,0

With a cold wave gripping the city heaters are keeping the large- and medium-sized carnivores warm at Mysuru zoo.  The drop in night temperatures has forced zoo keepers to boost the heat in the holding rooms of tigers lions and leopards.  Based on the night temperature the room temperature of the animal holding rooms is artificially increased using heaters.  Chimpanzees have been given warm material such as woollen blankets to keep warm at night.  Gunny bags too have been placed inside their rooms for the smart primates to crawl inside and sleep snugly.  Besides adjusting the temperature the zoo authorities have also changed the the dietary plans of some animals to help them adjust to the fluctuating temperatures.  C.  Ravishankar the zoos executive director told The Hindu that the zoo veterinarians were keeping an eye on the animals.  All large carnivores such as tigers lions and leopards are not being kept in the day crawl at night and are being let inside their holding rooms.  But in the case of medium-sized carnivores such as wild dogs hyenas and wolves the animal gets to choose between staying outdoors in the open enclosure or going inside the holding room where heaters regulate the temperature.  “We have kept woollen blankets inside the holding rooms of chimps.  They sleep on the clothing to keep themselves warm.  And the heaters are placed outside the animal holding rooms and are switched on for a specific period of time under the supervision of the keepers” Mr.  Ravishankar said.  However over the past couple of days the day temperatures have risen here forcing the authorities to manage both the day and night temperatures.  Water jets which are usually operated in the summer are being used now to keep animals such as elephants and Indian gaur cool.  Water is sprayed even on deers and sambars.  If the day temperature is high water jets are opened at lion enclosures too the director added. ,CLIMATE_CHANGE,0

Earthquake strikes [PLACE-ARG] California [PLACE-ARG],An earthquake measuring 60 struck [PLACE-ARG] Northern California [PLACE-ARG]  on 24 August at 320 local time, Earthquake strikes California.  An earthquake measuring 6.0 struck Northern California on 24 August at 3:20 local time.  The earthquake had a depth of 10.7 km 6.6 miles and was located 6 km 4 miles NW of American Canyon and 9 km 6 miles SSW of Napa.  Several smaller afershocks have followed the main event.  It is the largest earthquake to hit Bay Area since the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 In Napa 89 people have been injured of which 3 are serious.  Fortunetly no deaths have been reported so far. 69000 people have also been left without power.  The earthquake has caused significant damage in Napa and American Canyon.  Bridges and roads have been damaged including a bridge in American Canyon which has been closed due to the damage sustained.  Several historical buildings in Napa have been severaly damaged which includes the City Hall and two commercial buildings.  Fires caused by the earthquakes destroyed four mobile homes.  According to reports there were approximatley 50 gas main breaks and 60 leaks from damaged water mains.  The earthquake was caused by the San Andreas fault system which is where the Pacific is moving northwest in relation to the North American plate.  This movement causes a right lateral slip across the faults.  According to the USGS the location of the earthquake was near the West Napa Fault which is located between two major strike slip fault systems the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault system on the west and the Concord-Green Valley Fault system on the east.  As assessments are carried out the extent and severity of the damage will become clear over the next few hours or days.

MUMBAI: In a major terror strike after the November 26 2008 carnage in Mumbai nine persons including four foreigners all women were killed and over 40 injured in a bomb blast which ravaged the famous German Bakery on North Main Avenue in Punes Koregaon Park near the Osho Ashram around 7.30 p.m. on Saturday.  Unofficial figures put the number of injured at 50 Initially the police said it was a gas cylinder blast but the explosion is now suspected to be an improvised explosive device IED using an ammonium nitrate fuel oil mix with RDX as a booster police sources said.  About 7 kg explosives may have been used.  The bodies were charred beyond recognition.  Chief Minister Ashok Chavan said preliminary reports indicated that it was a bomb blast.  An eyewitness who was travelling in an autorickshaw said he heard a loud explosion and blacked out.  Another eyewitness said bodies were scattered and more than 10 were seen at the site.  Four shops were damaged near the bakery which has been there for 22 years.  The bag containing the bomb was said to be under a table according to one account and a waiter is said to have tried to open it.  This caused the explosion which devastated the bakery located near the Jewish Chabad House.  A customer said he heard the blast but escaped unhurt.  There were bodies lying all around he said.  Sources said the bakery was close to a hotel where Lashkar-e-Taiba operative David Headley had stayed while visiting Osho Ashram.  However Headley did not recce this bakery.  Soon after the blast an unidentified bag was found in an autorickshaw.  It contained 7 kg of explosives.  The Anti-Terrorism Squad ATS has also reached Pune apart from forensic experts.  The National Investigation Agency NIA will reach there by Sunday.  The blast has sent shockwaves in Pune prompting a high alert in Mumbai and other cities in Maharashtra.  The police have been asked to look out for unattended baggage.  Joint Commissioner of Police Rajendra Sonawane said that prima facie it looked like a bomb blast.  Congress city president Abhay Chhajed confirmed the number of deaths.  “I myself have seen six bodies at the Sassoon Hospital.  There are more at other hospitals.”.  He said the injured had been taken to Ruby Hall Jehangir Budhrani and Sassoon hospitals in the city.  The bakery is a popular spot with foreign tourists.  Six or eight of the injured are said to be foreign nationals.  Mr.  Chavan has announced ex gratia payment of Rs. 1 lakh to each of the families of the deceased and Rs. 50000 for the injured.  Security for the Indian and South African cricket teams has been tightened.  The second test match is beginning in Kolkata on Sunday.

The two militants were hiding in an under-construction multi-storey building at Karan Nagar after they failed to attack a Central Reserve Police Force CRPF camp in the wee hours on Monday.  The government had imposed restrictions in the old city to avoid any law and order situation during the anti-militancy operation.  “The encounter concluded this afternoon.  In the operation two terrorists were killed.  Their identity is being ascertained.  The incriminating material we recovered from them suggests they were from the Lashkar-e-Toiba” Inspector General of Police Kashmir Swayam Prakash Pani said.  During the encounter one CRPF man was killed and one policeman suffered bullet injuries but his condition is stable.  The IGP said the operation was carried out in the congested locality and a lot of civilian population was around.  “While the operation was planned immediately the civilian population was moved from the area and we thank the citizens of Srinagar city for cooperating with us.  Because of the help of the community we could take out the residents from the encounter site.  Subsequently a deliberate assault line was planned by the CRPF and Special Operation Group of the J&K Police.  There was no collateral damage during the operation” he said.  Sources privy to the operation said the highly-trained militants were shifting from one room to another and that prolonged the operation.  “We fired a number of rockets to break the walls of the building.  Once we were successful in it the militant movement was restricted and they took position on the ground floor.  At 11 am we were able to neutralise the first militant” a security official said.  The exchange of fire continued and another militant was injured.  “At around 1 am the final assault was launched inside the building and the second militant was killed an hour later” he said.  Two AK-47 rifles eight AK-47 magazines and other war-like stores were recovered from the encounter site.

The sentry opened fire and the militants fled from the spot and took shelter in a partially constructed multi-storey building in the area.

Iran plane crash No survivors [CASUALTIES-ARG] bodies buried in snow [CASUALTIES-ARG]  as wreckage found on mountain,There were no survivors among the 65 passengers and crew on an Iranian plane that ploughed into a mountain top where [CASUALTIES-ARG] most of the bodies lie buried under snow [CASUALTIES-ARG]  the first rescue team to reach the wreckage said on Tuesday, Iran plane crash: No survivors bodies buried in snow as wreckage found on mountain.  There were no survivors among the 65 passengers and crew on an Iranian plane that ploughed into a mountain top where most of the bodies lie buried under snow the first rescue team to reach the wreckage said on Tuesday.  The Aseman Airlines plane disappeared from radar screens 50 minutes into Sundays flight from Tehran to the southwestern city of Yasuj.  Iranian military located the wreckage in the central province of Isfahan on Tuesday morning.  “Only parts of the airplane are visible and the rest is deeply buried.  The rescue team have seen 30 bodies on the ground” an official from Irans Red Crescent was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.  The remaining passengers and crew were buried under the snow the official said.  “The plane had hit top of the mountain before crashing 30 metres 100 feet further down” the pilot of a rescue helicopter told state television.  Glacial temperatures and the mountainous terrain hampered search and rescue efforts adding to the grief and anger felt by families of the victims in a society plagued by risky air travel where officials blame decades of sanctions for the poor state of national fleet.  The twin-engined turboprop ATR 72 that crashed was over 24 years old.  According to data cited by the Flight Safety Foundations aviation-safety.net. website it was restored to service just three months ago after being in storage for six years.  More than 100 people demonstrated on Monday outside a local government office in nearby Dena Kooh county demanding officials step down for their handling of the disaster after announcements that wreckage had been found on Monday were then denied.  A video on Tasnim showed an angry man shouting “Would you have flown on the same plane?”. at Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi.  Revolutionary Guards spokesman Ramezan Sharif told state television the wreckage was eventually spotted by a military drone.  After a long wait to locate the plane relatives will have to endure further delays until the bodies are returned as helicopters are unable to land in the hostile terrain and the work will have to be carried out on foot an emergency service official said.  Iran has suffered several plane crashes in recent decades.  Tehran blames U.S. sanctions for preventing it from importing new aircraft or spare parts.  A Boeing 727 crashed in northwest Iran in 2011 killing 78 people and in 2009 all 168 people on board died when a Caspian Airlines Tupolev crashed en route for Armenia.  In 2003 an Ilyushin-76 troop carrier crashed in southeast Iran killing all 276 Revolutionary Guard soldiers and crew.  A deal with world powers on Tehrans nuclear programme in 2015 opened the way for Iranian airlines to update their fleets but many older planes are still in service particularly on domestic routes. ,TRANSPORT_HAZARDS,1

A huge forest fire in central Portugal killed at least 24 people and injured 20 others most of them burning to death in their cars the government said.  Around 500 firefighters and 160 vehicles were dispatched to tackle the blaze which broke out on Saturday afternoon in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande before spreading.  “What we are seeing is a great tragedy.  For the moment 24 deaths are confirmed but the number of fatalities could still rise” Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at the Civil Protection headquarters near Lisbon.  “The priority now is to get the ongoing fire under control -- after that we must understand what happened” he said.  Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes earlier said all 19 of the people then confirmed dead were civilians.  “Three of them died from smoke inhalation and 16 burned to death in their cars when they found themselves trapped by flames on the road from Figueiro dos Vinhos to Castanheira de Pera” Gomes told journalists.  Fourteen civilians were injured 10 of them seriously along with six firefighters he added.  The flames spread “with great violence” moving out on four fronts he said.  Several villages were affected by the blaze but Gomes was not immediately able to comment on the extent of the damage caused.  President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet families of the victims “sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people” he said.  Firefighters did “all they could” when faced with the blaze he added.  Portugal was sweltering under a severe heatwave Saturday with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in several regions.  The country was hit by a series of fires last year which devastated more than 1000 square km of the mainland.  Fires on the tourist island of Madeira in August killed three people while over the course of 2016 around 40 homes were destroyed and 5400 hectares of land burned. ,FIRE,1

Earthquake strikes [PLACE-ARG] California [PLACE-ARG],An earthquake measuring 60 struck [PLACE-ARG] Northern California [PLACE-ARG]  on 24 August at 320 local time, Earthquake strikes California.  An earthquake measuring 6.0 struck Northern California on 24 August at 3:20 local time.  The earthquake had a depth of 10.7 km 6.6 miles and was located 6 km 4 miles NW of American Canyon and 9 km 6 miles SSW of Napa.  Several smaller afershocks have followed the main event.  It is the largest earthquake to hit Bay Area since the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 In Napa 89 people have been injured of which 3 are serious.  Fortunetly no deaths have been reported so far. 69000 people have also been left without power.  The earthquake has caused significant damage in Napa and American Canyon.  Bridges and roads have been damaged including a bridge in American Canyon which has been closed due to the damage sustained.  Several historical buildings in Napa have been severaly damaged which includes the City Hall and two commercial buildings.  Fires caused by the earthquakes destroyed four mobile homes.  According to reports there were approximatley 50 gas main breaks and 60 leaks from damaged water mains.  The earthquake was caused by the San Andreas fault system which is where the Pacific is moving northwest in relation to the North American plate.  This movement causes a right lateral slip across the faults.  According to the USGS the location of the earthquake was near the West Napa Fault which is located between two major strike slip fault systems the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault system on the west and the Concord-Green Valley Fault system on the east.  As assessments are carried out the extent and severity of the damage will become clear over the next few hours or days.  A state of emergency has been declared by the California Governer Jerry Brown. ,EARTHQUAKE,1

Since the beginning of January 2014 there had been an increase in both shallow and deep volcanogenic earthquakes along with an increase in water temperature at the crater lake leading to the alert level being raised to 3 out of 4 and a 5km restriction zone around the crater.  Approximately 90 minutes before the alert was raised to 4 the volcano erupted resulting in the explosion being heard 125 miles 200 km away and an ash column reaching 30 km into the atmosphere.  Over 200000 people in 36 villages located 6 miles 10 km from the volcano were advised to evacuate immediately. 3 international airports in Surabaya Solo and Yogyakarta have also been shut down due to the widespread ash which has been reported to be up to 5 cm thick.  Towns and cities as far away as 80 miles 130 km away have experienced ash falls up to 5 cm thick.  The ash fall also caused roofs to collapse under the weight of the ash leading to the 2 reported deaths.  Just a few centimetres of ash can cause roofs to collapse especially poorly constructed ones made of weak material.  Kelut also known as Kelud is a 1731 metres stratovolcano located on the island of Java.  Eruptions have dated back to 230 BCE and the volcano has had episodes of eruptions as large as a VEI 4 since then.  A VEI 4 eruption in 1919 lead to the death of over 5000 people and another VEI 4 eruption in February 1990 lead to the death of more than 30 people. ,VOLCANO,0

Over 200000 people in 36 villages located 6 miles 10 km from the volcano were advised to evacuate immediately. 3 international airports in Surabaya Solo and Yogyakarta have also been shut down due to the widespread ash which has been reported to be up to 5 cm thick.  Towns and cities as far away as 80 miles 130 km away have experienced ash falls up to 5 cm thick.  The ash fall also caused roofs to collapse under the weight of the ash leading to the 2 reported deaths.  Just a few centimetres of ash can cause roofs to collapse especially poorly constructed ones made of weak material.  Kelut also known as Kelud is a 1731 metres stratovolcano located on the island of Java.  Eruptions have dated back to 230 BCE and the volcano has had episodes of eruptions as large as a VEI 4 since then.  A VEI 4 eruption in 1919 lead to the death of over 5000 people and another VEI 4 eruption in February 1990 lead to the death of more than 30 people. ,VOLCANO,0

HYDERABAD: 25 students died and several others suffered severe injuries when a school bus was hit by Nanded Passenger train at an unmanned railway level crossing in Masaipet village of Medak district on Thursday morning.  All the students belong to Kakatiya Techno School in Toopran.  The mishap occurred at 9.10am. on Thursday morning when the school bus was crossing an unmanned level crossing at Masaipet village.  When the accident occurred there were 40 students from Islampur and Zakeerpalli villages in the bus and the incident occurred while the students were going to school.  Villagers allege that there was no one at the railway gate and this resulted in the accident.  Railway authorities for reasons best known to them had left the gate works unfinished at the level crossing.  Villagers alleged that they had brought to the notice of railway officials the need for a railway gate to avoid accidents.  They alleged that several accidents had occurred at the spot in the past.  The impact of the collision was so severe that the train dragged the bus for about a kilometre.  Villagers blame railway authorities for the mishap but grieving parents found fault with the bus driver for overspeeding and negligence while crossing the railway track.  Eyewitnesses said the bus driver did not notice the incoming train leading to the gory accident.  It all happened in no time.  Even before we realised what had happened it was all over.  Pieces of flesh and blood were strewn all around.  The bus was mangled beyond recognition.  It was a very sad sight a teacher who was present at the accident spot told mediapersons.  A mother who lost her child in the terrible tragedy said the bus left her house only 10 minutes earlier.  It was the last goodbye by my child she said amidst tears while recalling the tata waving of hand as a gesture of goodbye of her son.

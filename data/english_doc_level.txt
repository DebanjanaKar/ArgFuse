DOC:  3-year-old playing with stove may have started deadly New York fire.  A child playing with a stove may have caused the fire in a New York City apartment building that killed 12 people including four children Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday.  The fire the deadliest in the city in a quarter of a century broke out a little before 7pm EST midnight GMT on Thursday on the first floor of a brick building and quickly spread upstairs killing people on multiple floors the New York City Fire Department said. “What we think at this point is that unfortunately it emanated from an accident a young child playing with a stove on the first floor of the building” de Blasio said in an interview with WNYC radio.  Children ages 1 2 and 7 died along with four men and four women local media reported.An. unidentified boy also died.

DOC:  Bangladesh: 250 fall sick after toxic gas leak at fertiliser unit.  About 250 people including children have fallen sick and hundreds of residents have been evacuated from their homes after a toxic gas leak from a fertiliser unit in Bangladeshs port city of Chittagong officials said on Tuesday.  Di-ammonium phosphate DPA leaked from the DAP Fertiliser Company Limited on the bank of Karnaphuli river on Monday night and firefighters battled until late morning to plug the leakage.  DPA is one of a series of water-soluble ammonium phosphate salts that can be produced when ammonia reacts with phosphoric acid.  Reports quoting officials said one of the gas tanks with 500 tonne capacity leaked at around 11:30 PM last night.  The gas quickly spread across large parts of the city.  Strong winds blew the gas across a 10-kilometre radius and reports suggested that people felt breathing problems at the southern citys international airport. “The gas spread from the unit causing breathing problems to the people across several kilometres” officer-in-charge of the nearby police station said.  Of the nearly 250 taken ill 56 people including more than 10 children were admitted to hospitals in the port city.  All the people being treated were stated be out of danger.  Hundreds of residents were evacuated from their homes near the plant police and fire officials said. “Several people reported to doctors just because of panic” the citys civil surgeon Azizur Rahman Siddique said.  Chittagongs Deputy Commissioner Mesbahuddin Ahmed said the situation was under control as leakage has been plugged.  The reason behind the leak could not be known immediately.  Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation BCIC which runs the unit formed a 10-member committee to investigate the incident while the district administration has formed a three-member panel to probe the leak.  At the time of the incident the amount of ammonia in the air was recorded at 600ppm parts per million whilst workers at the factory can tolerate conditions with ammonia gas up to 25ppm the environment department said.  Experts said exposure to ammonia could cause slackening vomiting and breathing problems. “I have been informed that the fire service men nearly brought under control the situation” Chittagongs deputy commissioner Mesbahuddin Ahmed said.

DOC:  20 children among 100 killed as Syria attacks rebels in Eastern Ghouta.  Heavy Syrian bombardment killed at least 100 civilians in rebel-held eastern Ghouta on Monday a war monitor said as regime forces appeared to prepare for an imminent ground assault.  The escalation came as pro-government forces were also expected to enter the northern Kurdish-controlled enclave of Afrin to take a stand against a month-old Turkish assault there.  Held by rebels since 2012 Eastern Ghouta is the last opposition pocket around Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad has dispatched reinforcements there in an apparent concerted effort to retake it.  A barrage of air strikes rocket fire and artillery slammed into several towns across Eastern Ghouta on Monday.  The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 20 children were among 100 civilians killed in the assault while around 300 other people were wounded. “The regime is bombing Eastern Ghouta to pave the way for a ground offensive” said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.  The main opposition National Coalition which is based in Turkey denounced the “war of extermination” in Eastern Ghouta as well as the “international silence”.  In a statement it also accused regime ally Russia of seeking to “bury the political process” for a solution to the conflict.  Residents of Hammuriyeh could be seen rushing indoors in panic as soon as they heard the sound of airplanes.  Alaa al-Din a 23-year-old Syrian in Hammuriyeh said civilians were afraid of a potential government offensive. “Ghoutas fate is unknown.  Weve got nothing but Gods mercy and hiding out in our basements” he told AFP. “Theres no alternative.”.  Wailing children.  Shelling also hit the town of Douma where an AFP correspondent saw five toddlers brought to a hospital covered in dust and wailing uncontrollably.  The hospital was full of distraught civilians: one father slapped his forehead after finding his two dead children another erupted into tears as he discovered the body of his newborn on a purple sheet next to a pool of blood.  Eastern Ghouta is held by two main Islamist factions while jihadists control small pockets including one directly adjacent to the capital.  The Observatory and Syrian daily newspaper Al-Watan had said negotiations were under way for the evacuation of jihadists from Eastern Ghouta.  But escalating military pressure indicate that the regime would opt for a ground assault instead of talks the monitor said.  Government troops carried out a relentless five-day bombing campaign earlier this month that killed around 250 civilians in the enclave and wounded hundreds.  Around the same time the monitor said the regime began dispatching military reinforcements to Eastern Ghouta.  After days of relative calm the government sent more than 260 rockets sailing onto Eastern Ghouta on Sunday.  Those rockets as well as artillery fire and air strikes killed 17 civilians said the Observatory.  The regime is keen to regain control of Eastern Ghouta to halt the deadly salvo of rockets and mortars that rebels fire on Damascus.  About half a dozen rockets hit the capital Sunday night AFP correspondents said.  State news agency SANA reported that one person was killed.  More than 20 civilians have been killed by rebel fire this month alone in regime-held Damascus.  Regime to enter Afrin.  All was quiet in the capital on Monday but since rumours of an imminent assault on Eastern Ghouta started spreading people living close to the rebel enclave started packing their bags.  Jawad al-Obros 30 said he was looking to move to a hotel in the western sector of the city to escape his home in an east Damascus neighbourhood that has been regularly hit by rockets from Ghouta. “Were tired of this situation.  It seems that theres no solution but a full-blown military one” he told AFP.  More than 340000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict erupted in 2011 with protests against Assads government.  It has since evolved into a war that has carved up the country into rival zones of influence among the regime rebels jihadists and Kurdish forces.  The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units YPG control the northwestern region of Afrin target of a month-old assault by the Turkish army and allied Syrian rebels.  Turkey sees the YPG as a “terror” group linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party PKK outlawed by Ankara and wants to clear it from its southern border.  The YPG has controlled Afrin since 2012 when Syrian troops withdrew from it and other Kurdish-majority areas.  Syrian state media said Monday that pro-regime forces were preparing to enter the area to “join the resistance against the Turkish aggression”.  Turkey warned against any bid by the Syrian regime to help the YPG.  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke on the phone with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and according to Turkish media told him any support from Damascus to the YPG in Afrin “will have consequences” for the regime.

DOC:  New volcano discovered.  A new volcano has been discovered under the ice in Antarctica.  The active volcano which is currently unnamed was discovered by a group of scientists who had installed seismometers in the area.  It is the first volcano discovered under the ice in Antarctica.  After the seismometers were installed in 2010 in the Marie Byrd Land west of the continent two swarms of earthquakes were detected.  The earthquakes measured 0.8 and 2.1 with depths of 15 to 25 miles and were a year apart.  The shallow earthquakes with low frequency indicated that a volcano was present.  These earthquakes are known as Deep Long Period Earthquakes DPL which occur in volcanic areas.  The volcano is believed to have erupted in the past and will erupt in the again future causing the ice sheet to melt which in turn will result in a small rise in the sea level.

NAVI MUMBAI: A 25-year-old woman and her five-year-old daughter lost their lives in a fire at their cutlery-cum-artificial jewellery shop in sector 3 of Airoli around 3am on Thursday.  A short-circuit triggered the fire at Fashion Beauty Store and the smoke engulfed a residence on the floor above which was occupied by the Choudharys.  The family of five comprising three minor children was asleep while a relative was sleeping inside the shop.  The deceased are Manju Choudhary and Gayatri.  Manjus husband Amraram Choudhary 30 daughter Anjali 3 and son Durgesh 1 managed to escape before the fire brigade arrived.  Airoli fire brigade sub-officer Sandesh Channe said “We rushed to the spot within five minute of receiving the call at 3.03am.  As the shops shutter was closed from inside we broke it open and extinguished the fire.  Before we reached the spot the two men and two minors had managed to exit.  But the woman and her older daughter were trapped inside.  Using a ladder the duo was brought down but they were declared brought dead on arrival at a private hospital in Airoli.”.

NAVI MUMBAI: A 26-year-old navy lieutenant posted at INS Shivaji in Lonavla died of head injuries after his car rear-ended into a truck parked illegally in the third lane of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway early on Sunday.  Police suspect the victim Srikanth Obaya Nagipogu who was returning to Lonavla after a meeting in Mumbai might have not seen the truck as it was dark and crashed into it JUST ahead of Bhatan tunnel near Kon village.  Panvel taluka police arrested the truck driver Dilawar Hamid Patel 42 who hails from Karad and booked him under the Indian Penal Code for causing death by negligence and rash driving among other charges.  Motorists are prohibited from halting their vehicle on the Expressway.  Patel claimed that he pulled into the extreme left lane on the Pune carriageway as he suspected his truck had developed some mechanical fault said police sub-inspector Nilesh Taru.  Patel claimed he was under the truck checking for any faults when the car crashed into his vehicle from behind around 3.30am.  He said as he could not remove the driver from the car which was badly mangled he waited for police to arrive.  The highway safety patrol police reached the spot minutes after receiving the information from the control room.  We suspect the truck driver had parked his vehicle to take a nap.  But as there are no other witnesses we cannot confirm it said Tare.  If he was feeling sleepy he should have parked his vehicle in the service lane and not the third lane.  After post-mortem police handed over Nagipogus body to his brother in the presence of naval officers.  The brother has taken the body to their home town in Andhra Pradeshs Kadapa district for the final rites said police sub-inspector Neelam Pawar.

Residents on the western fringes of the Greek capital struggled Thursday to clean up the devastation from flash floods that swept through their neighborhoods a day earlier while the death toll rose as rescue crews searching for missing people recovered another body.  The number of deaths from Wednesdays flooding increased to 16 after firefighters found the body of a man in the swamped basement of a home in the Nea Peramos district west of Athens.  Search and rescue operations were continuing Thursday for four more people reported missing since the floods turned roads into violent torrents of mud and debris.  The disaster was among the worst to hit the Greek capital in decades and the government declared a day of national mourning.  Flags across the country flew at half-staff Thursday including at the ancient Acropolis landmark in Athens.  The hardest hit area was Mandra a modest working-class district on the western outskirts of the Greek capital where nearly all the fatalities occurred.  Authorities said about 500 homes and businesses were damaged.  Wednesdays flash floods which came after a severe overnight CYCLONE carried away vehicles collapsed walls sank fishing boats and submerged a section of a major highway “There is huge damage.  Inestimable damage” Mandra Mayor Ioanna Kriekouki told local media.  Twelve of the 23 injured remained hospitalized including an 82-year-old woman listed as being in serious condition in an intensive care unit the National Health Operations Center said.  Cars lay piled on top of each other or flung against buildings after being carried away by the torrents sweeping through the areas streets.  Some houses and businesses saw outer walls collapse leaving the interior exposed to the elements.  Rubble twisted metal and smashed vehicles lined the roads. “As you can see everything is a mess” said local resident Katerina Sideri.  More CYCLONEs lashed the Greek capital on Thursday temporarily severing traffic on one of Athens main central avenues although they did not cause flash floods.  Local municipalities were providing hotel rooms for those left homeless while the Merchant Marine Ministry said it was making arrangements for a cruise ship to dock on the coast near the affected area to provide temporary accommodation.  It also said arrangements were being made with the army and navy to provide water tankers to transport clean water to residents.  Nearly all the injuries and fatalities occurred in Mandra and the surrounding area.  Twelve of the dead were found there while the bodies of two men were picked up by the coast guard after having been swept out to sea by the flood.  The victims ranged in ages from mid-30s to 80s and included a truck driver swept away by floodwater a hunter and several people who drowned in their flooded homes.  Most of those who died had drowned a coroner at the hospital told local reporters while some appeared to have died from injuries sustained from debris being carried by the floodwater.  The fire department said Thursday it had received 660 calls for help to pump water from flooded homes and businesses since Wednesday morning while it had rescued 88 people trapped in houses and vehicles.  All fire services in the wider Athens area remained on alert as more bad weather was forecast for the area.

A life-threatening blizzard expected to dump a record 30 inches of snow on the US capital slammed the east coast today leaving at least nine persons dead nationwide and causing 10 states to declare a state of emergency.  Officials urged millions of people in the CYCLONEs path to seek shelter and brace for a weekend of travel disruptions.  The states most hit by the blizzard were Georgia North Carolina Tennessee Maryland Virginia Pennsylvania New Jersey New York and Kentucky in addition to Washington DC which has declared a “snow emergency.”.  In Virginia which has a large Telugu population media. reported several weather-related accidents yesterday.  Virginia State Police responded to more than 800 traffic accidents.  In a statement the North American Telugu Association urged members to stay indoors and take precautions for safety.  A number of temples and other places of worship including gurdwaras in the region have opened up to shelter people.  Up to 85 million people — about one quarter of the US population — were in the path of the CYCLONE that has iced up much of the East Coast and the Mid-Atlantic.  At least nine people have died reports said.  Latest estimates suggest more than 120000 homes have been left without electricity as the CYCLONE dubbed “Snowzilla”. by some US media began dumping several inches of snow across the region.  Governors in at least 10 American states have declared states of emergency while Washington is likely to be covered under 30 inches of snow over the weekend in what could be a record snowfall. “We have a forecast that we did not have in 90 years.  It has life-and-death implication and all the residents of the District of Columbia should treat it that way” Washington DC Mayor Miriel E Bowser said.  He said District National Guard has been deployed.  Local governments have deployed hundreds of plows and salt trucks to clear out snow on roads and highways.  With temperatures below the freezing point people stayed indoors and found shelters to keep warm.  Unlike a normal Friday night most of the downtowns malls and restaurants were deserted and hardly any traffic was seen on the road.  More than 6000 flights were canceled between yesterday and today and over 4500 delayed.

DOC:  Strong earthquake strikes Chile.  A magnitude 8.2 earthquake with a depth of 20.1 km 12.5 miles struck Chile on 1st April 2014 at 23:46.  The earthquake upgraded by the USGS from a magnitude 8.0 to 8.2 was located 95 km 59 miles northwest of Iquique northern Chile.  According to the USGS the earthquake was a result of thrust faulting at shallow depths near the Countrys coastline.  This earthquake follows on from increased seismicity in the area over recent days with earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 and below occurring with same faulting mechanisms. 6 deaths have so far been confirmed and several injured. 300 inmates in Iquique escaped jail amongst the chaos caused by the earthquake and 131 have now returned voluntarily.  The Chilean army has been sent to the city to help relocate the remaining prisoners along with prevent looting.  The earthquake caused damage to houses power cuts fire landslides and road blockages.  Damage has however been limited considering the size of the earthquake.  Several tsunami watches and warnings were issued in Chile Peru Ecuador Colombia Panama Costa Rica Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala Mexico and Hondorus following the earthquake causing thousands along the low-lying coastal areas to evacuate to higher ground.  Most of these watches and warnings have now been lifted after a 2.1m. wave hit some areas around the coast and residents have returned.  Strong aftershocks have followed on from the earthquake.  The true extent of the damage caused will become clear over the next few hours as assessments are carried out.

DOC:  Strong quake hits northeast Japan no tsunami risk.  A strong earthquake struck northeast of Tokyo on Wednesday but there was no fear of a tsunami Japans meteorological agency said.  It put the magnitude at 6.3 while the US Geological Survey measured it at 5.9 The quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres 18 km north-northeast of the town of Daigo.  There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters adding that no abnormalities were detected at nuclear power plants in the region.  Japan sits at the junction of four tectonic plates and experiences a number of relatively violent quakes every year.  But rigid building codes and strict enforcement mean even strong tremors often do little damage.  A massive undersea quake that hit in March 2011 sent a tsunami barrelling into Japans northeast coast leaving more than 18000 people dead or missing and sending three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant.  In April two strong earthquakes hit southern Japans Kumamoto prefecture followed by more than 1700 aftershocks leaving at least 50 dead and causing widespread damage.

DOC:  In Madagascar plague outbreak now threatens largest cities. Madagascar has fought the disease for more than a century. It was introduced to the island in 1898 when steamships from India brought rats infected with the bacteria that causes the disease. As plague cases rose last week in Madagascars capital many city dwellers panicked. They waited in long lines for antibiotics at pharmacies and reached through bus windows to buy masks from street vendors. Schools have been canceled and public gatherings are banned. The plague outbreak has killed 63 people in the Indian Ocean island nation. Madagascars government says For the first time the disease long seen in the countrys remote areas is largely concentrated in its two largest cities Antananarivo and Toamasina. Global health officials have responded quickly. The World Health Organization criticized for its slow response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa has released $1.5 million and sent plague specialists and epidemiologists. The Red Cross is sending its first-ever plague treatment center to Madagascar. On Wednesday, Madagascars Minister of Public Health rallied doctors and paramedics in a packed auditorium at the countrys main hospital saying theyre not allowed to go on vacation. “Lets be strong because its only us Were at the front like the military”, Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo said. The outbreak could continue until the end of infection season in April experts warn. Madagascar has about 400 plague cases per year or more than half of the worlds total according to a 2016 World Health Organization report. Usually they are cases of bubonic plague in the rural highlands. Bubonic plague is carried by rats and spread to humans through flea bites. It is fatal about the half the time if untreated. Most of the cases in the current outbreak are pneumonic plague, a more virulent form that spreads through coughing sneezing or spitting and is almost always fatal if untreated. In some cases it can kill within 24 hours. Like the bubonic form, it can be treated with common antibiotics if caught in time. The WHO calls plague a “disease of poverty” caused in part by unsanitary living conditions. Madagascar has a per capita GDP of about $400 and national programs to control the disease have been “hampered by operational and management difficulties” according to a report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. But the airborne pneumonic plague which accounts for about 75 % of cases in the current outbreak makes no class distinctions. “Normally the people who catch the plague are dirty people who live in poor areas but in this case we find the well-to-do, the directors, the professors, people in every place in society catching the disease”, said Dr Manitra Rakotoarivony Madagascars, director of health promotion. The current outbreak began in August earlier than usual when a 31-year-old man who had spent time in a village in the central highlands Ankazobe traveled by bush taxi to the east coast unaware that he had the plague. He died en route and was buried without any safety precautions in Toamasina. Four people in contact with him also died. Residents of the capital began to relax in recent days amid the global response to the outbreak but the disease remains a serious threat with the number of new cases per day remaining steady. Madagascar has fought the disease for more than a century. It was introduced to the island in 1898 when steamships from India brought rats infected with the bacteria that causes the disease. The plague nearly disappeared from Madagascar for 60 years starting in 1930 but re-emerged in recent decades. The black rats that carry the disease in the highlands have gradually developed resistance to it. Unsafe burial practices that involve touching corpses are another reason the disease spreads according to a 2015 study by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar. The outbreak has alarmed neighboring countries. A 34-year-old man in another Indian Ocean island nation the Seychelles contracted the pneumonic plague while in Madagascar. He was treated in his own country and no longer has symptoms. It was the first-ever plague case in the Seychelles, said the countrys public health commissioner Dr Jude Gedeon. Another Seychellois, a 49-year-old basketball coach died of the plague last month while in Antananarivo for a tournament. Seychelles authorities have established a plague isolation ward and announced that schools will be closed through Tuesday. Foreign travelers who have recently visited Madagascar are not being allowed into the country. While the WHO says the risk of the epidemic spreading beyond the region is very low and does not advise restrictions on travel to Madagascar, Air Seychelles has canceled all flights to and from the island until further notice. “The situation is still not under control in Madagascar”, Mr Gedeon said.

JAKARTA: A strong earthquake shook Indonesias densely populated Java island on Friday night killing two people and severely damaging dozens of homes near the epicenter.  The magnitude 6.5 quake struck at 11:47pm on Friday and was felt across the island including about 200 kilometers 124 miles away in the capital Jakarta where office towers and apartment buildings swayed.  Powerful tremors lasted as much as 30 seconds in places.  Panicking people ran out of buildings in many areas and roads were clogged with motorbikes cars and trucks as people fled coastal areas in fear of a tsunami.  Ahmad Solihin a food vendor in a coastal area of the Sukabumi region said his village was jolted by a 20-second tremor that cracked walls in his home.  He fled on his motorbike with his wife and two children after neighbors shouted that water was coming he said.  People suddenly started running so I joined them said Solihin.  More than 1000 villagers in his area evacuated to higher ground and didnt return until Saturday morning after authorities convinced them it was safe he said.  A 62-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman were killed in building collapses said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.  Damage was heaviest in the Tasikmalaya Pangandaran and Ciamis regions of West Java Province near the epicenter.  More than 40 houses collapsed and about 65 suffered severe damage said Nugroho.  The earthquake was about 91 kilometers 56 miles deep and located just inland the US Geological Survey said.  It triggered a tsunami warning for parts of Javas coastline that was lifted about two hours later.  No significant waves were reported.  Several hospitals were damaged by the shaking and patients evacuated.  Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

DOC:  In Madagascar plague outbreak now threatens largest cities. Madagascar has fought the disease for more than a century. It was introduced to the island in 1898 when steamships from India brought rats infected with the bacteria that causes the disease. As plague cases rose last week in Madagascars capital many city dwellers panicked. They waited in long lines for antibiotics at pharmacies and reached through bus windows to buy masks from street vendors. Schools have been canceled and public gatherings are banned. The plague outbreak has killed 63 people in the Indian Ocean island nation. Madagascars government says For the first time the disease long seen in the countrys remote areas is largely concentrated in its two largest cities Antananarivo and Toamasina. Global health officials have responded quickly. The World Health Organization criticized for its slow response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa has released $1.5 million and sent plague specialists and epidemiologists. The Red Cross is sending its first-ever plague treatment center to Madagascar. On Wednesday, Madagascars Minister of Public Health rallied doctors and paramedics in a packed auditorium at the countrys main hospital saying theyre not allowed to go on vacation. “Lets be strong because its only us Were at the front like the military”, Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo said. The outbreak could continue until the end of infection season in April experts warn. Madagascar has about 400 plague cases per year or more than half of the worlds total according to a 2016 World Health Organization report. Usually they are cases of bubonic plague in the rural highlands. Bubonic plague is carried by rats and spread to humans through flea bites. It is fatal about the half the time if untreated. Most of the cases in the current outbreak are pneumonic plague, a more virulent form that spreads through coughing sneezing or spitting and is almost always fatal if untreated. In some cases it can kill within 24 hours. Like the bubonic form, it can be treated with common antibiotics if caught in time. The WHO calls plague a “disease of poverty” caused in part by unsanitary living conditions. Madagascar has a per capita GDP of about $400 and national programs to control the disease have been “hampered by operational and management difficulties” according to a report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. But the airborne pneumonic plague which accounts for about 75 % of cases in the current outbreak makes no class distinctions. “Normally the people who catch the plague are dirty people who live in poor areas but in this case we find the well-to-do, the directors, the professors, people in every place in society catching the disease”, said Dr Manitra Rakotoarivony Madagascars, director of health promotion. The current outbreak began in August earlier than usual when a 31-year-old man who had spent time in a village in the central highlands Ankazobe traveled by bush taxi to the east coast unaware that he had the plague. He died en route and was buried without any safety precautions in Toamasina. Four people in contact with him also died. Residents of the capital began to relax in recent days amid the global response to the outbreak but the disease remains a serious threat with the number of new cases per day remaining steady. Madagascar has fought the disease for more than a century. It was introduced to the island in 1898 when steamships from India brought rats infected with the bacteria that causes the disease. The plague nearly disappeared from Madagascar for 60 years starting in 1930 but re-emerged in recent decades. The black rats that carry the disease in the highlands have gradually developed resistance to it. Unsafe burial practices that involve touching corpses are another reason the disease spreads according to a 2015 study by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar. The outbreak has alarmed neighboring countries. A 34-year-old man in another Indian Ocean island nation the Seychelles contracted the pneumonic plague while in Madagascar. He was treated in his own country and no longer has symptoms. It was the first-ever plague case in the Seychelles, said the countrys public health commissioner Dr Jude Gedeon. Another Seychellois, a 49-year-old basketball coach died of the plague last month while in Antananarivo for a tournament. Seychelles authorities have established a plague isolation ward and announced that schools will be closed through Tuesday. Foreign travelers who have recently visited Madagascar are not being allowed into the country. While the WHO says the risk of the epidemic spreading beyond the region is very low and does not advise restrictions on travel to Madagascar, Air Seychelles has canceled all flights to and from the island until further notice. “The situation is still not under control in Madagascar”, Mr Gedeon said.

DOC:  Blast near foreign contractors car in Kabul 4 injured.  Kabul March 2 An explosion near a vehicle belonging to foreign workers left at least four people injured on Friday in eastern Kabul an area where many expatriates reside the Afghan interior ministry said.  It was not immediately clear if the explosion was a bomb.  The blast hit “an international contractor companys car” interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish told AFP adding that the four wounded were all civilians.  Local media showed images of damage to houses and shops in the area.  If confirmed as an attack it would be the latest to hit Kabul which is one of the deadliest places in Afghanistan for civilians as both the Taliban and the expanding Islamic State group step up their assaults on the city.  The explosion also comes just days after Afghan president Ashraf Ghani unveiled a plan for peace talks with the Taliban including a proposal to eventually recognise them as a political party.  Ghani revealed his plans in a speech during international peace talks in Kabul this week that went better than expected with officials in Washington daring to hold out hope that the longest war in its history may be heading to a negotiated settlement.  But Kabul remains on high alert fearing further violence.  Since mid-January militants have CYCLONEed a luxury hotel bombed a crowded street raided a military compound and launched a suicide attack during morning rush hour in the capital killing more than 130 people. — AFP.

DOC:  25 killed in Bangla factory blaze.  A fire at a food and cigarette packaging factory in Bangladesh killed at least 25 people and injured over 70 today in the countrys worst industrial accident since the Rana Plaza building collapse of 2013 in which over 1100 people died.  Emergency officials feared the death toll could climb after a fire broke out in the Tongi Industrial Zone about 20km north of Dhaka.  The cause was not immediately known but officials said a boiler explosion probably triggered the blaze at around 0200 GMT as workers prepared to swap shifts.  There were about 100 people inside the building when fire broke out Mohammad Nayan a worker who was helping with rescue efforts told reporters.  Officials at the site said over 20 fire fighting teams were working to quell the blaze at the Tampaco Foils plant which caused the partial collapse of the factory building.  We cannot confirm whether any people are inside or not but our priority is to rescue them if there is anyone inside Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman a fire department official at the site told Reuters over the phone.  Another fire official said that although the blaze was under control there were still flames inside the building so fire fighters had been unable to search the debris.  A manager at Tampaco Foils said he did not know how many people were inside the factory when the blaze broke out.  Now my only focus is on my workers who were injured and on those who died.  We will take care of them said Syed Mokbul Hossain chair of Tampaco and a former MP.  My company is fully compliant and Ive never sacrificed on quality as my clients are mainly multinational companies.  Tampacos website says its clients include several local companies and global brands including British American Tobacco and Nestle.  Fire department officials initially identified the factory as a garment packaging plant but later clarified that it packs food and cigarettes.  The fire will further tarnish the industrial safety record of one of the worlds top garment exporters.  In the Rana Plaza disaster 1135 mainly garment industry workers were killed when a building collapsed outside Dhaka.  That sparked demands for greater safety in the country.  The disaster led to the creation of two international coalitions designed to help fund improvements to building and fire safety at thousands of garment factories across Bangladesh.  So far our focus was only on readymade garment factories but now this disaster has opened our eyes to the fact that we should also focus on other factories Syed Ahmed the head of the Department of Inspection for factories in Bangladesh told Reuters.

DOC:  Palestinian on boat from Gaza killed by Israeli fire: Army.  A Palestinian was killed Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on a boat from the Gaza Strip after it left a zone where Israel allows Palestinians to fish officials said.  A spokeswoman for the Israeli army said the boat “deviated from the designated fishing zone in the northern Gaza Strip.”.  Naval forces called on the boat to halt then fired warning shots in the air before shooting toward it when the three people on board did not stop the spokeswoman said.  A severely wounded Palestinian later died from his injuries she said.  The other two Palestinian “suspects” were detained by security forces.  The fishermens union in Gaza said a boat with three fishermen was fired upon by Israels military.  Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza run by Islamist movement Hamas have fought three wars since 2008 and the territory has been under an Israeli blockade for more than 10 years.  Fishing off the northern part of the strip adjacent to Israel is limited to six nautical miles offshore and the Israeli navy regularly fires warning shots or at Palestinians who breach it.  Such incidents rarely result in deaths.  Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif Qanoua called the incident “an ugly crime the occupation is responsible for and a form of continuing aggression against our Palestinian people.”.

DOC:  50 dead in suicide bomb attack at Nigeria mosque.  Kano: A suicide bomber has killed at least 50 people at a mosque in the north-eastern Nigerian town of Mubi police say.  The teenage bomber detonated his explosives early on Tuesday in Adamawa state as people were arriving for morning prayers.  Police spokesman Othman Abubakar said that the young man was mingling among the worshippers.  Ahmed Musa chairman of Mubi council said dozens of people had been injured.  Police were still trying to ascertain the number of injured because they are in various hospitals Mr Abubakar said.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the attack bears the hallmark of Boko Haram which typically mounts suicide attacks in crowded public places such as mosques and markets.  Tuesdays attack is the highest loss of life since 18 people were killed in neighbouring Borno state in September.  Boko Haram has waged an insurgency in north-east Nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an Islamic state in the region killing more than 20000 and forcing about 2 million people to flee their homes.  Most attacks by the group focus on Borno state the birthplace of the insurgency.  The group held a swathe of land around the size of Belgium in Borno Adamawa and Yobe states until early 2015 but were forced out by Nigerias army backed by troops from neighbouring countries.

DOC:  Bangladesh: 250 fall sick after toxic gas leak at fertiliser unit.  About 250 people including children have fallen sick and hundreds of residents have been evacuated from their homes after a toxic gas leak from a fertiliser unit in Bangladeshs port city of Chittagong officials said on Tuesday.  Di-ammonium phosphate DPA leaked from the DAP Fertiliser Company Limited on the bank of Karnaphuli river on Monday night and firefighters battled until late morning to plug the leakage.  DPA is one of a series of water-soluble ammonium phosphate salts that can be produced when ammonia reacts with phosphoric acid.  Reports quoting officials said one of the gas tanks with 500 tonne capacity leaked at around 11:30 PM last night.  The gas quickly spread across large parts of the city.  Strong winds blew the gas across a 10-kilometre radius and reports suggested that people felt breathing problems at the southern citys international airport. “The gas spread from the unit causing breathing problems to the people across several kilometres” officer-in-charge of the nearby police station said.  Of the nearly 250 taken ill 56 people including more than 10 children were admitted to hospitals in the port city.  All the people being treated were stated be out of danger.  Hundreds of residents were evacuated from their homes near the plant police and fire officials said. “Several people reported to doctors just because of panic” the citys civil surgeon Azizur Rahman Siddique said.  Chittagongs Deputy Commissioner Mesbahuddin Ahmed said the situation was under control as leakage has been plugged.  The reason behind the leak could not be known immediately.  Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation BCIC which runs the unit formed a 10-member committee to investigate the incident while the district administration has formed a three-member panel to probe the leak.  At the time of the incident the amount of ammonia in the air was recorded at 600ppm parts per million whilst workers at the factory can tolerate conditions with ammonia gas up to 25ppm the environment department said.  Experts said exposure to ammonia could cause slackening vomiting and breathing problems. “I have been informed that the fire service men nearly brought under control the situation” Chittagongs deputy commissioner Mesbahuddin Ahmed said.

Six security personnel were injured.  The police described their condition as “stable”.  The encounter broke out about 8 km from the Line of Control LoC on Tuesday morning after a police patrol intercepted a group of militants.  A joint team of the Kupwara police along with companies of the Army the Territorial Army TA and the Central Reserve Police Force were engaged in the operation.  The Lashkar-e-Toiba militants managed to sneak in crossing two ridges of the Shamsabari mountain range.  They reportedly met their “reception party” overground workers and militants in the Valley on crossing the LoC and were proceeding towards Kupwara when spotted by a police patrol officials said.  Hiding inside a mosque two of them were killed on Tuesday as they ran towards the forest area.  Another militant who had positioned himself at a height and was firing on approaching security personnel was killed later in the evening.  The security forces eliminated two more militants in the Halmatpora Chak forests on Wednesday.

DOC:  Six killed in Lahore bombing.  A Taliban suicide bomber today killed six persons and himself in a brazen attack on police headquarters in Lahore.  According to the militants the attack was a revenge bid for the recent hangings of colleagues.  It was the third in a series of high-profile attacks in the last month triggered by a government decision in December to begin hanging those convicted of terror attacks reversing an informal six-year moratorium on the death penalty.  We claim the attack in Lahore because the government is killing our men in prison said Ehsanullah Ehsan a spokesman for powerful Taliban splinter group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.  We will get revenge for every man and our struggle will continue until sharia is instituted in the country he said referring to Islamic law.  Punjab police chief Mushtaq Sukhera said a policeman and four civilians were among the dead.  Jam Hussain a spokesman for the emergency services said six bodies had been recovered along with the attackers.  At least 23 people were injured said Khawaja Salman Rafique health adviser to the chief minister of Punjab.  Casualties would have been much greater if the police had not been alert and kept out the bomber Lahore police chief Amin Wains told reporters at the attack site.  It was a suicide blast the bomber blew up prematurely outside the police offices he added.  That he could not enter the offices shows our security was successful.  Ali Raza the owner of a shop nearby said the blast had been powerful enough to knock over one of his employees and left body parts strewn in the street.  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to hold peace talks with the Taliban after he came to power in elections in 2012 But the talks failed and last June the military launched an offensive to drive the Taliban from their stronghold.  Several militant attacks followed culminating in a December Taliban massacre at a school in Peshawar that killed 134 children and 19 adults.

A life-threatening blizzard expected to dump a record 30 inches of snow on the US capital slammed the east coast today leaving at least nine persons dead nationwide and causing 10 states to declare a state of emergency.  Officials urged millions of people in the CYCLONEs path to seek shelter and brace for a weekend of travel disruptions.  The states most hit by the blizzard were Georgia North Carolina Tennessee Maryland Virginia Pennsylvania New Jersey New York and Kentucky in addition to Washington DC which has declared a “snow emergency.”.  In Virginia which has a large Telugu population media. reported several weather-related accidents yesterday.  Virginia State Police responded to more than 800 traffic accidents.  In a statement the North American Telugu Association urged members to stay indoors and take precautions for safety.  A number of temples and other places of worship including gurdwaras in the region have opened up to shelter people.  Up to 85 million people — about one quarter of the US population — were in the path of the CYCLONE that has iced up much of the East Coast and the Mid-Atlantic.  At least nine people have died reports said.  Latest estimates suggest more than 120000 homes have been left without electricity as the CYCLONE dubbed “Snowzilla”. by some US media began dumping several inches of snow across the region.

After the seismometers were installed in 2010 in the Marie Byrd Land west of the continent two swarms of earthquakes were detected.  The earthquakes measured 0.8 and 2.1 with depths of 15 to 25 miles and were a year apart.  The shallow earthquakes with low frequency indicated that a volcano was present.  These earthquakes are known as Deep Long Period Earthquakes DPL which occur in volcanic areas.  The volcano is believed to have erupted in the past and will erupt in the again future causing the ice sheet to melt which in turn will result in a small rise in the sea level.

DOC:  Portugal forest fire: At least 24 killed most of them burned in their cars.  A huge forest fire in central Portugal killed at least 24 people and injured 20 others most of them burning to death in their cars the government said.  Around 500 firefighters and 160 vehicles were dispatched to tackle the blaze which broke out on Saturday afternoon in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande before spreading. “What we are seeing is a great tragedy.  For the moment 24 deaths are confirmed but the number of fatalities could still rise” Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at the Civil Protection headquarters near Lisbon. “The priority now is to get the ongoing fire under control -- after that we must understand what happened” he said.  Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes earlier said all 19 of the people then confirmed dead were civilians. “Three of them died from smoke inhalation and 16 burned to death in their cars when they found themselves trapped by flames on the road from Figueiro dos Vinhos to Castanheira de Pera” Gomes told journalists.  Fourteen civilians were injured 10 of them seriously along with six firefighters he added.  The flames spread “with great violence” moving out on four fronts he said.  Several villages were affected by the blaze but Gomes was not immediately able to comment on the extent of the damage caused.  President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet families of the victims “sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people” he said.  Firefighters did “all they could” when faced with the blaze he added.  Portugal was sweltering under a severe heatwave Saturday with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in several regions.  The country was hit by a series of fires last year which devastated more than 1000 square km of the mainland.

Forty-four people were killed and 103 injured when one Iranian passenger train collided with another at a station about 250km east of the capital Tehran state media reported.  I was sleeping when the crash happened.  I thought it was an air strike.  When I opened my eyes there was blood everywhere a hospitalised passenger told state television.  State television footage showed four derailed carriages two of them on fire and a spokesman for Irans Red Crescent Mostafa Mortazavi told the semi-official Fars news agency that firefighters were trying to control the blaze.  Senior health ministry official later announced via Tasnim news agency that rescue operations had been completed and the final death toll was 44 An investigation into the cause of the crash in the northern province of Semnan was continuing.  Semnan provincial governor Mohammad Reza Khabbaz told Iranian television it appeared that a train entering the Haft-Khan station on the outskirts of Shahroud ploughed into another that had broken down there.  The initial investigation suggests that a mechanical failure possibly caused by cold weather forced the express train operating between the cities of Tabriz and Mashhad to stop at Haft-Khan Khabbaz said.  Tabriz state governor Rahim Shohratifar told Tasnim that the moving train had 400 passengers.  It was not clear how many passengers were on the stationary train.  Fars earlier reported that 100 passengers had been rescued.  Semi-official Mehr news agency said four of the dead were railway employees aboard the trains.  Irans rail network aged badly under economic sanctions imposed over its disputed nuclear programme making it difficult to modernise rolling stock and safety standards suffered.  The sanctions were lifted in January after Iran reached a deal with world powers to limit its nuclear activity.

Kabul: A suicide bomber in the Afghan capital killed at least 20 on Thursday after blowing himself up close to a group of security personnel who were carrying out an operation against illegal drugs and alcohol dealing officials said.  The Islamic State which has claimed a series of attacks in Kabul over the past two years issued a statement on its Amaq news agency saying it was responsible.  The outfit said a suicide bomber targeting a group of police and intelligence service personnel had detonated an explosive vest.  Wahid Majroh a spokesman for the ministry of public health said 11 dead and 25 wounded had been brought to city hospitals after the blast in an area of the city not far from the US embassy and other foreign missions.  As security forces arrived a Reuters reporter saw four police vehicles carrying dead or wounded security personnel from the scene.  Police officers said the bomber had been wearing police or army uniform and had approached a group of security personnel conducting controls on illegal drugs and alcohol sellers but there was no official confirmation.  Kabul police forces were there to prevent a possible protest when a suicide bomber approached them and detonated his suicide vest Kabul police spokesman Bashir Mujahid said.  While Afghan forces backed by US air strikes have claimed some success against Taliban insurgents since the US announced a stepped up military strategy last year high profile attacks on civilian targets in Kabul have continued.  The attack happened days after a suicide bomber killed at least 41 people and wounded more than 80 at a Shia cultural centre in Kabul.

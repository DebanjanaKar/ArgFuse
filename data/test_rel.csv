Since the beginning of January 2014 there had been an increase in both shallow and deep volcanogenic earthquakes along with an increase in water temperature at the crater lake leading to the alert level being raised to 3 out of 4 and a 5km restriction zone around the crater. Approximately 90 minutes before the alert was raised to 4 the volcano erupted resulting in the explosion being heard 125 miles 200 km away and an ash column reaching 30 km into the atmosphere. Over 200000 people in 36 villages located 6 miles 10 km from the volcano were advised to evacuate immediately. 3 international airports in Surabaya Solo and Yogyakarta have also been shut down due to the widespread ash which has been reported to be up to 5 cm thick. Towns and cities as far away as 80 miles 130 km away have experienced ash falls up to 5 cm thick. The ash fall also caused roofs to collapse under the weight of the ash leading to the 2 reported deaths. Just a few centimetres of ash can cause roofs to collapse especially poorly constructed ones made of weak material. Kelut also known as Kelud is a 1731 metres stratovolcano located on the island of Java. Eruptions have dated back to 230 BCE and the volcano has had episodes of eruptions as large as a VEI 4 since then. A VEI 4 eruption in 1919 lead to the death of over 5000 people and another VEI 4 eruption in February 1990 lead to the death of more than 30 people. ,VOLCANO,1

The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York estimated in a report released last month that about [AFTER_EFFECTS-ARG] 114000 to 213000 Puerto Rican residents will leave the island annually [AFTER_EFFECTS-ARG]  as a result of Hurricane Maria,,Puerto Rico population to drop 14% after Hurricane Maria wreckage. Puerto Ricos population is set to decrease by 14 per cent to 2.9 million inhabitants by 2019 due to an exodus of residents fleeing the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in September a study has found. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York estimated in a report released last month that about 114000 to 213000 Puerto Rican residents will leave the island annually “as a result of Hurricane Maria.”. Between 2017 and 2019 the US territory stands to lose 470335 residents it added. “In the decade prior to Hurricane Maria net migration from Puerto Rico to the United States amounted to approximately half a million which represented a loss of ten percent of the islands population” said report authors Edwin Melendez and Jennifer Hinojosa. “In other words Puerto Rico will lose the same population in a span of a couple of years after Hurricane Maria as the island lost during a prior decade of economic stagnation.”. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans have fled to the mainland since Maria struck on September 20 devastating the island just two weeks after Hurricane Irma tore through the Caribbean. The vast majority went to Florida and New York which already had around one million Puerto Ricans each. Around 700000 Puerto Ricans live in New York City. Overall there are five million Puerto Ricans on the US mainland compared to 3.4 million on the island. Melendez and Hinojosa estimate that between 40000 and 82000 people will migrate to Florida each year from Puerto Rico. That figured has already been topped with a Florida emergency management official telling AFP that more than 134000 Puerto Ricans have arrived in Florida since October 3 through the international airports of Tampa Orlando and Miami. But its unclear how many are moving to Florida permanently compared to how many are simply visiting temporarily. The move is one of the biggest obstacles to recovery for the island which has been beset by financial hardship. “The population decrease in Puerto Rico… has multiple economic repercussions for the island” Jorge Duany an anthropologist at Florida International University who specializes in Puerto Rican migration said in an interview. As of Monday only 42 percent of Puerto Rican customers had electricity on the island which went dark after Maria. At least 51 people died because of the CYCLONE according to official figures while the local press speaks of dozens of people who have disappeared. Some 2600 people still live in shelters. ,STORM,1

The move is one of the biggest obstacles to recovery for the island which has been beset by financial hardship. “The population decrease in Puerto Rico… has multiple economic repercussions for the island” Jorge Duany an anthropologist at Florida International University who specializes in Puerto Rican migration said in an interview. As of Monday only 42 percent of Puerto Rican customers had electricity on the island which went dark after Maria. At least 51 people died because of the CYCLONE according to official figures while the local press speaks of dozens of people who have disappeared. Some 2600 people still live in shelters. ,STORM,1
Large eruption at Mount Kelut forces evacuation [CASUALTIES-ARG] 2 people have been killed and over 100000 people have been forced to evacuate from the vicinity [CASUALTIES-ARG]  of Mount Kelut Kelud after it erupted explosively on 13th February at around 2329 local time,,Large eruption at Mount Kelut forces evacuation. 2 people have been killed and over 100000 people have been forced to evacuate from the vicinity of Mount Kelut Kelud after it erupted explosively on 13th February at around 23:29 local time. Since the beginning of January 2014 there had been an increase in both shallow and deep volcanogenic earthquakes along with an increase in water temperature at the crater lake leading to the alert level being raised to 3 out of 4 and a 5km restriction zone around the crater. Approximately 90 minutes before the alert was raised to 4 the volcano erupted resulting in the explosion being heard 125 miles 200 km away and an ash column reaching 30 km into the atmosphere. Over 200000 people in 36 villages located 6 miles 10 km from the volcano were advised to evacuate immediately. 3 international airports in Surabaya Solo and Yogyakarta have also been shut down due to the widespread ash which has been reported to be up to 5 cm thick. Towns and cities as far away as 80 miles 130 km away have experienced ash falls up to 5 cm thick. The ash fall also caused roofs to collapse under the weight of the ash leading to the 2 reported deaths. Just a few centimetres of ash can cause roofs to collapse especially poorly constructed ones made of weak material. Kelut also known as Kelud is a 1731 metres stratovolcano located on the island of Java. Eruptions have dated back to 230 BCE and the volcano has had episodes of eruptions as large as a VEI 4 since then. A VEI 4 eruption in 1919 lead to the death of over 5000 people and another VEI 4 eruption in February 1990 lead to the death of more than 30 people. ,VOLCANO,0

At this current time wildfires are also burning in [PLACE-ARG] California and New Mexico [PLACE-ARG]  with many of them being caused by lightning strikes,,Record Breaking Colorado Wildfires. A large wildfire which broke out on Tuesday the 11th June has destroyed over 300 homes and left two people dead in the Springs area of Colorado in the US. The fire named the Black Forest Fire has been declared the most destructive fire in the States history. Since its outbreak along Colorados Front Range it has quickly spread by high winds and record heat to burn 12 square miles of land. As the fires continue to burn uncontrollably it has forced an evacuation of 7000 people. Unfortunately not everyone fled in time with 2 deaths already confirmed from a burnt out car in the area. It is feared that the death toll may rise in the coming days. Another fire has also hit 60 miles southwest of the Black Forest Fire near Royal Gorge Bridge Park which has burnt 6 square miles of land and is still yet to be controlled. This fire has caused 900 inmates from Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility to be evacuated because of the heavy smoke in the area. In total 3 structures have been destroyed near Canon City but no deaths have been reported. All fires have unknown causes at this time. However another fire which was detected on Monday in the Rocky Mountains was confirmed to be from a lightning strike. The fire caused 300 acres of land to burn but no structures were threatened. At this current time wildfires are also burning in California and New Mexico with many of them being caused by lightning strikes.

Areas under the Ramganj Manak Chowk Subhash Chowk and Galta Gate police stations remained under curfew from [TIME-ARG] 2 am late Friday night to 8 pm on Saturday [TIME-ARG]  after several vehicles were set ablaze by the mob,,Curfew in Jaipur after scuffle escalates 1 killed. Curfew was clamped in parts of the walled city of Jaipur after one person was killed and four policemen were injured late Friday night after a traffic scuffle escalated into a full-blown conflict between police and residents of the Muslim-majority Ramganj locality. The district administration has suspended mobile Internet services for two days – from 6 am on Saturday to 11.59 pm Sunday – to check rumours from spreading. Trouble started at about 8:30 pm on Friday when a police constable during a routine clearing of street vendors allegedly hit a Muslim couple – local resident Sajid and his wife – who were passing by on a bike. “We were just passing by when the policemen stopped us. Then a constable swung his baton and hit our bike. My husband was hit on his hand and my little daughter fell off the bike. I tried to stop the constable but he pushed me aside” Sajids wife told local news channels outside the police station. The incident led to a heated verbal exchange after which the couple reached the Ramganj police station. “It was a minor scuffle and while the policemen were talking to the couple a crowd gathered outside the station. They started pelting stones and engaged in vandalism and arson. Police used light force to disperse them by firing tear gas shells and shots in the air. One Mohammad Raees alias Adil was injured and taken to SMS Hospital in the city where he passed away at about 1 am” Police Commissioner Sanjay Agarwal told The Sunday Express adding “The cause of his death will be ascertained only after we have the postmortem report.”. Agarwal said four policemen were also injured and were rushed to the trauma centre of the hospital. One of them he said was seriously injured. “The situation is under control now. Our teams are patrolling the area and peace committee meetings are being held to restore normalcy” he said. While police claimed they had to use force because the mob had turned unruly Muslim organisations said police used excessive force without giving the crowd a chance to disperse. “Police did not even wait for the crowd to disperse after the lathicharge. Eyewitnesses told us they only fired two-three tear gas shells and then started firing. Also they could have fired in the air or aimed at the protesters legs. Adil died from a bullet wound on his chest” Mohd Iqbal Siddiqi spokesperson of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind said. Areas under the Ramganj Manak Chowk Subhash Chowk and Galta Gate police stations remained under curfew from 2 am late Friday night to 8 pm on Saturday after several vehicles were set ablaze by the mob. ,TERRORIST_ATTACK,1

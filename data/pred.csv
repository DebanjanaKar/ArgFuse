JAKARTA Indonesias capital Jakarta was rocked on [TIME-ARG] Tuesday [TIME-ARG]  by a strong earthquake which forced some buildings to be evacuated but there was no immediate tsunami threat or reported injuries a government agency said,At least three people were killed following a 65magnitude earthquake just outside the coastal town of Cipatujah on Java island in [TIME-ARG] midDecember [TIME-ARG],Strong quake of magnitude 6.0 rocks Jakarta: USGS. JAKARTA: Indonesias capital Jakarta was rocked on Tuesday by a strong earthquake which forced some buildings to be evacuated but there was no immediate tsunami threat or reported injuries a government agency said. The United States Geological Survey said the 6.0 magnitude quake struck at a depth of 43 kilometres 27 miles. That contrasted with an initial report from the Indonesian Meteorology Climatology and Geophysics agency which said the quake had a 6.4 magnitude at a shallower 10 kilometre depth. The epicentre was off the coast about 130 kilometres southwest of the sprawling city. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where tectonic plates collide causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity. At least three people were killed following a 6.5-magnitude. earthquake just outside the coastal town of Cipatujah on Java island in mid-December. The tremor was felt across the densely populated island causing damage to hundreds of houses and other buildings. An earthquake struck Indonesias western province of Aceh in December 2016 killing more than 100 people injuring many more and leaving tens of thousands homeless. Aceh was one of the areas worst worst hit by the devastating 2004 triggred by a magnitude 9.3 undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra. The wall of waves killed 220000 people in countries around the Indian Ocean including 168000 in Indonesia. ,EARTHQUAKE

That contrasted with an initial report from the Indonesian Meteorology Climatology and Geophysics agency which said the quake had a 6.4 magnitude at a shallower 10 kilometre depth. The epicentre was off the coast about 130 kilometres southwest of the sprawling city. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where tectonic plates collide causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity. At least three people were killed following a 6.5-magnitude. earthquake just outside the coastal town of Cipatujah on Java island in mid-December. The tremor was felt across the densely populated island causing damage to hundreds of houses and other buildings. An earthquake struck Indonesias western province of Aceh in December 2016 killing more than 100 people injuring many more and leaving tens of thousands homeless. Aceh was one of the areas worst worst hit by the devastating 2004 triggred by a magnitude 9.3 undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra. The wall of waves killed 220000 people in countries around the Indian Ocean including 168000 in Indonesia. ,EARTHQUAKE

Among the victims of Cyclone Cempaka were 25 people killed by a single landslide in east Java last week the agency said. The initial cyclone death toll was 19 Some 28000 people have been displaced by the CYCLONE which hit Indonesias most populous island last week. Almost five thousand homes have been damaged and more than three thousand others were inundated by flooding said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. The destruction from the cyclone came as the rumbling Mount Agung volcano on the neighbouring resort island of Bali threatened to erupt forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. Cempaka has moved away from Indonesia but Nugroho warned that more flooding and landslides still could happen. Indonesia is prone to natural disasters and is often hit by floods and landslides.

JAKARTA: Indonesias capital Jakarta was rocked on Tuesday by a strong earthquake which forced some buildings to be evacuated but there was no immediate tsunami threat or reported injuries a government agency said. The United States Geological Survey said the 6.0 magnitude quake struck at a depth of 43 kilometres 27 miles. That contrasted with an initial report from the Indonesian Meteorology Climatology and Geophysics agency which said the quake had a 6.4 magnitude at a shallower 10 kilometre depth. The epicentre was off the coast about 130 kilometres southwest of the sprawling city. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where tectonic plates collide causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity. At least three people were killed following a 6.5-magnitude. earthquake just outside the coastal town of Cipatujah on Java island in mid-December. The tremor was felt across the densely populated island causing damage to hundreds of houses and other buildings. An earthquake struck Indonesias western province of Aceh in December 2016 killing more than 100 people injuring many more and leaving tens of thousands homeless.

That contrasted with an initial report from the Indonesian Meteorology Climatology and Geophysics agency which said the quake had a 6.4 magnitude at a shallower 10 kilometre depth. The epicentre was off the coast about 130 kilometres southwest of the sprawling city. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where tectonic plates collide causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity. At least three people were killed following a 6.5-magnitude. earthquake just outside the coastal town of Cipatujah on Java island in mid-December. The tremor was felt across the densely populated island causing damage to hundreds of houses and other buildings. An earthquake struck Indonesias western province of Aceh in December 2016 killing more than 100 people injuring many more and leaving tens of thousands homeless. Aceh was one of the areas worst worst hit by the devastating 2004 triggred by a magnitude 9.3 undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra. The wall of waves killed 220000 people in countries around the Indian Ocean including 168000 in Indonesia. ,EARTHQUAKE

A new volcano has been discovered under the ice in [PLACE-ARG] Antarctica [PLACE-ARG],After the seismometers were installed in 2010 in the [PLACE-ARG] Marie Byrd Land west of the continent [PLACE-ARG]  two swarms of earthquakes were detected,New volcano discovered. A new volcano has been discovered under the ice in Antarctica. The active volcano which is currently unnamed was discovered by a group of scientists who had installed seismometers in the area. It is the first volcano discovered under the ice in Antarctica. After the seismometers were installed in 2010 in the Marie Byrd Land west of the continent two swarms of earthquakes were detected. The earthquakes measured 0.8 and 2.1 with depths of 15 to 25 miles and were a year apart. The shallow earthquakes with low frequency indicated that a volcano was present. These earthquakes are known as Deep Long Period Earthquakes DPL which occur in volcanic areas. The volcano is believed to have erupted in the past and will erupt in the again future causing the ice sheet to melt which in turn will result in a small rise in the sea level. ,VOLCANO

NAVI MUMBAI: A 25-year-old woman and her five-year-old daughter lost their lives in a fire at their cutlery-cum-artificial jewellery shop in sector 3 of Airoli around 3am on Thursday. A short-circuit triggered the fire at Fashion Beauty Store and the smoke engulfed a residence on the floor above which was occupied by the Choudharys. The family of five comprising three minor children was asleep while a relative was sleeping inside the shop. The deceased are Manju Choudhary and Gayatri. Manjus husband Amraram Choudhary 30 daughter Anjali 3 and son Durgesh 1 managed to escape before the fire brigade arrived. Airoli fire brigade sub-officer Sandesh Channe said “We rushed to the spot within five minute of receiving the call at 3.03am. As the shops shutter was closed from inside we broke it open and extinguished the fire. Before we reached the spot the two men and two minors had managed to exit.

Strong earthquake strikes [PLACE-ARG] Chile [PLACE-ARG],Strong earthquake strikes [PLACE-ARG] Chile [PLACE-ARG],Strong earthquake strikes Chile. A magnitude 8.2 earthquake with a depth of 20.1 km 12.5 miles struck Chile on 1st April 2014 at 23:46. The earthquake upgraded by the USGS from a magnitude 8.0 to 8.2 was located 95 km 59 miles northwest of Iquique northern Chile. According to the USGS the earthquake was a result of thrust faulting at shallow depths near the Countrys coastline. This earthquake follows on from increased seismicity in the area over recent days with earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 and below occurring with same faulting mechanisms. 6 deaths have so far been confirmed and several injured. 300 inmates in Iquique escaped jail amongst the chaos caused by the earthquake and 131 have now returned voluntarily. The Chilean army has been sent to the city to help relocate the remaining prisoners along with prevent looting. The earthquake caused damage to houses power cuts fire landslides and road blockages. Damage has however been limited considering the size of the earthquake. Several tsunami watches and warnings were issued in Chile Peru Ecuador Colombia Panama Costa Rica Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala Mexico and Hondorus following the earthquake causing thousands along the low-lying coastal areas to evacuate to higher ground. Most of these watches and warnings have now been lifted after a 2.1m. wave hit some areas around the coast and residents have returned. Strong aftershocks have followed on from the earthquake. The true extent of the damage caused will become clear over the next few hours as assessments are carried,EARTHQUAKE

A magnitude 8.2 earthquake with a depth of 20.1 km 12.5 miles struck Chile on 1st April 2014 at 23:46. The earthquake upgraded by the USGS from a magnitude 8.0 to 8.2 was located 95 km 59 miles northwest of Iquique northern Chile. According to the USGS the earthquake was a result of thrust faulting at shallow depths near the Countrys coastline. This earthquake follows on from increased seismicity in the area over recent days with earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 and below occurring with same faulting mechanisms. 6 deaths have so far been confirmed and several injured. 300 inmates in Iquique escaped jail amongst the chaos caused by the earthquake and 131 have now returned voluntarily. The Chilean army has been sent to the city to help relocate the remaining prisoners along with prevent looting. The earthquake caused damage to houses power cuts fire landslides and road blockages. Damage has however been limited considering the size of the earthquake. Several tsunami watches and warnings were issued in Chile Peru Ecuador Colombia Panama Costa Rica Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala Mexico and Hondorus following the earthquake causing thousands along the low-lying coastal areas to evacuate to higher ground. Most of these watches and warnings have now been lifted after a 2.1m. wave hit some areas around the coast and residents have returned. Strong aftershocks have followed on from the earthquake. The true extent of the damage caused will become clear over the next few hours as assessments are carried,EARTHQUAKE

A strong earthquake struck northeast of Tokyo on Wednesday but there was no fear of a tsunami Japans meteorological agency said. It put the magnitude at 6.3 while the US Geological Survey measured it at 5.9 The quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres 18 km north-northeast of the town of Daigo. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters adding that no abnormalities were detected at nuclear power plants in the region. Japan sits at the junction of four tectonic plates and experiences a number of relatively violent quakes every year. But rigid building codes and strict enforcement mean even strong tremors often do little damage. A massive undersea quake that hit in March 2011 sent a tsunami barrelling into Japans northeast coast leaving more than 18000 people dead or missing and sending three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant.

Madagascar has fought the disease for more than a century. It was introduced to the island in 1898 when steamships from India brought rats infected with the bacteria that causes the disease. As plague cases rose last week in Madagascars capital many city dwellers panicked. They waited in long lines for antibiotics at pharmacies and reached through bus windows to buy masks from street vendors. Schools have been canceled and public gatherings are banned. The plague outbreak has killed 63 people in the Indian Ocean island nation Madagascars government says. For the first time the disease long seen in the countrys remote areas is largely concentrated in its two largest cities Antananarivo and Toamasina. Global health officials have responded quickly. The World Health Organization criticized for its slow response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa has released $1.5 million and sent plague specialists and epidemiologists. The Red Cross is sending its first-ever plague treatment center to Madagascar.

Local media showed images of damage to houses and shops in the area. If confirmed as an attack it would be the latest to hit Kabul which is one of the deadliest places in Afghanistan for civilians as both the Taliban and the expanding Islamic State group step up their assaults on the city.

Although the CYCLONE weakened as it moved inland and has now dissipated the region is still suffering from its consequences and the Mexican government have allocated money to help communities which have been devastated. A total of three people have said to have died from the CYCLONE with a mother and son being swept away whilst in a van because of dangerous river levels. In the eastern Pacific a hurricane named Cosme has developed being a category 1 hurricane the CYCLONE is sustaining winds of 80mph.

Police spokesman Othman Abubakar said that the young man was mingling among the worshippers. Ahmed Musa chairman of Mubi council said dozens of people had been injured.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the attack bears the hallmark of Boko Haram which typically mounts suicide attacks in crowded public places such as mosques and markets. Tuesdays attack is the highest loss of life since 18 people were killed in neighbouring Borno state in September. Boko Haram has waged an insurgency in north-east Nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an Islamic state in the region killing more than 20000 and forcing about 2 million people to flee their homes. Most attacks by the group focus on Borno state the birthplace of the insurgency. The group held a swathe of land around the size of Belgium in Borno Adamawa and Yobe states until early 2015 but were forced out by Nigerias army backed by troops from neighbouring countries. ,TERRORIST

The Islamic State which has claimed a series of attacks in Kabul over the past two years issued a statement on its Amaq news agency saying it was responsible.

As security forces arrived a Reuters reporter saw four police vehicles carrying dead or wounded security personnel from the scene. Police officers said the bomber had been wearing police or army uniform and had approached a group of security personnel conducting controls on illegal drugs and alcohol sellers but there was no official confirmation.

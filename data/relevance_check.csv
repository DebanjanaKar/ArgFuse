Severe Tropical Cyclone Gita is intensifying as it approaches and the Fiji Meteorological Service predicted it will become a maximum category five CYCLONE before reaching Tonga on Monday night.  It is already packing wind gusts of 220 kmh 137 mph as it gathers strength some 370 kilometres east of Tongas most populous island Tongatapu.  Tongas Fuaamotu Weather Forecasting Centre warned residents could expect very destructive hurricane force winds.  Gita slammed into Samoa overnight Friday forcing the evacuation of some 200 people and causing widespread flooding leaving many without power and electricity.  Tongas information ministry said evacuation centres were being prepared across the kingdom and advised residents to avoid unnecessary travel.  Every family should have an emergency kit packed in their homes it said.  Everyone should be mindful of what might cause damage within their homes such as large trees that can potentially damage a house.  Cyclones are common in the Pacific at this time of year with top-of-the-scale category five systems proving highly destructive when they make landfall.  Cyclone Winston killed 44 people in Fiji in 2016 and Cyclone Pam claimed 11 lives and damaged 65000 homes in Vanuatu in 2015,STORM,1,

On [TIME-ARG] January 4 [TIME-ARG]  a fire had broken out at a similar early hour in a shopping mall at Damana in Bhubaneswar,, Fire destroys garment store 3 adjacent shops in Cuttack.  CUTTACK: A three-storey garment store in the busy Palamandap locality of the city was completely gutted in a blazing fire which also reduced three nearby shops to ashes on Sunday.  No loss of life was reported in the mishap nor was any one injured.  The store had no fire safety equipment in place said fire fighters.  At around 11.25 am some of the customers in the store noticed a fire - caused reportedly due to a short circuit - and alerted its staff.  Salespersons and customers were immediately guided out of the showroom.  People also vacated the nearby buildings as soon as word spread of the fire.  The fire was so severe that 21 fire tenders and 160 personnel had to be pressed into action to douse the flames in an operation that lasted for more than five hours.  Locals have claimed that property worth crores was gutted in the fire.  I was standing near the store when heavy smoke began billowing out.  Within minutes the entire three-storey store was engulfed in flames.  The fire spread to the two other shops located in the neighbouring building said Srikant Das an eye-witness.  Das said there were very few customers in the store as it had just opened.  On January 4 a fire had broken out at a similar early hour in a shopping mall at Damana in Bhubaneswar.  With the stretch leading up to the store encroached upon by shops fire tenders had a tough time reaching the site.  Firemen also struggled to control the flames on Sunday as the garment store was filled with inflammable materials and had no fire safety equipment in place.  The store had no fire safety licence which is mandatory.  The store is over 100 feet high but the breadth of the staircase was only 1.5 feet.  Our men had to demolish walls and use hydraulic stairs to enter the structure and put out the flames said chief fire officer Sukant Sethi.  An electricity transformer is located outside the showroom - a fact that had triggered panic among many who were watching the scene from the roads.  Luckily firemen controlled the flames before they reached the transformer otherwise the results would have been disastrous said Laxman Agarwal another eye-witness.  Vehicular movement on the stretch from Badambadi to Link Road was affected for hours after the mishap.

CUTTACK: A three-storey garment store in the busy Palamandap locality of the city was completely gutted in a blazing fire which also reduced three nearby shops to ashes on Sunday.  No loss of life was reported in the mishap nor was any one injured.  The store had no fire safety equipment in place said fire fighters.  At around 11.25 am some of the customers in the store noticed a fire - caused reportedly due to a short circuit - and alerted its staff.  Salespersons and customers were immediately guided out of the showroom.  People also vacated the nearby buildings as soon as word spread of the fire.  The fire was so severe that 21 fire tenders and 160 personnel had to be pressed into action to douse the flames in an operation that lasted for more than five hours.  Locals have claimed that property worth crores was gutted in the fire.  I was standing near the store when heavy smoke began billowing out.  Within minutes the entire three-storey store was engulfed in flames.  The fire spread to the two other shops located in the neighbouring building said Srikant Das an eye-witness.  Das said there were very few customers in the store as it had just opened.  On January 4 a fire had broken out at a similar early hour in a shopping mall at Damana in Bhubaneswar.  With the stretch leading up to the store encroached upon by shops fire tenders had a tough time reaching the site.  Firemen also struggled to control the flames on Sunday as the garment store was filled with inflammable materials and had no fire safety equipment in place.  The store had no fire safety licence which is mandatory.  The store is over 100 feet high but the breadth of the staircase was only 1.5 feet.  Our men had to demolish walls and use hydraulic stairs to enter the structure and put out the flames said chief fire officer Sukant Sethi.  An electricity transformer is located outside the showroom - a fact that had triggered panic among many who were watching the scene from the roads.  Luckily firemen controlled the flames before they reached the transformer otherwise the results would have been disastrous said Laxman Agarwal another eye-witness.  Vehicular movement on the stretch from Badambadi to Link Road was affected for hours after the mishap.  Director general of fire services B K Sharma has ordered an inquiry into the incident to find out the exact cause behind the problem. ,FIRE,1,

It is the largest earthquake to hit Bay Area since the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 In Napa 89 people have been injured of which 3 are serious.  Fortunetly no deaths have been reported so far. 69000 people have also been left without power.  The earthquake has caused significant damage in Napa and American Canyon.  Bridges and roads have been damaged including a bridge in American Canyon which has been closed due to the damage sustained.  Several historical buildings in Napa have been severaly damaged which includes the City Hall and two commercial buildings.  Fires caused by the earthquakes destroyed four mobile homes.  According to reports there were approximatley 50 gas main breaks and 60 leaks from damaged water mains.  The earthquake was caused by the San Andreas fault system which is where the Pacific is moving northwest in relation to the North American plate.  This movement causes a right lateral slip across the faults.  According to the USGS the location of the earthquake was near the West Napa Fault which is located between two major strike slip fault systems the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault system on the west and the Concord-Green Valley Fault system on the east.  As assessments are carried out the extent and severity of the damage will become clear over the next few hours or days.  A state of emergency has been declared by the California Governer Jerry Brown. ,EARTHQUAKE,1,

A Boeing 727 crashed in northwest Iran in 2011 killing 78 people and in [TIME-ARG] 2009 [TIME-ARG]  all 168 people on board died when a Caspian Airlines Tupolev crashed en route for Armenia,, Iran plane crash: No survivors bodies buried in snow as wreckage found on mountain.  There were no survivors among the 65 passengers and crew on an Iranian plane that ploughed into a mountain top where most of the bodies lie buried under snow the first rescue team to reach the wreckage said on Tuesday.  The Aseman Airlines plane disappeared from radar screens 50 minutes into Sundays flight from Tehran to the southwestern city of Yasuj.  Iranian military located the wreckage in the central province of Isfahan on Tuesday morning.  “Only parts of the airplane are visible and the rest is deeply buried.  The rescue team have seen 30 bodies on the ground” an official from Irans Red Crescent was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.  The remaining passengers and crew were buried under the snow the official said.  “The plane had hit top of the mountain before crashing 30 metres 100 feet further down” the pilot of a rescue helicopter told state television.  Glacial temperatures and the mountainous terrain hampered search and rescue efforts adding to the grief and anger felt by families of the victims in a society plagued by risky air travel where officials blame decades of sanctions for the poor state of national fleet.  The twin-engined turboprop ATR 72 that crashed was over 24 years old.  According to data cited by the Flight Safety Foundations aviation-safety.net. website it was restored to service just three months ago after being in storage for six years.  More than 100 people demonstrated on Monday outside a local government office in nearby Dena Kooh county demanding officials step down for their handling of the disaster after announcements that wreckage had been found on Monday were then denied.  A video on Tasnim showed an angry man shouting “Would you have flown on the same plane?”. at Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi.  Revolutionary Guards spokesman Ramezan Sharif told state television the wreckage was eventually spotted by a military drone.  After a long wait to locate the plane relatives will have to endure further delays until the bodies are returned as helicopters are unable to land in the hostile terrain and the work will have to be carried out on foot an emergency service official said.  Iran has suffered several plane crashes in recent decades.  Tehran blames U.S. sanctions for preventing it from importing new aircraft or spare parts.  A Boeing 727 crashed in northwest Iran in 2011 killing 78 people and in 2009 all 168 people on board died when a Caspian Airlines Tupolev crashed en route for Armenia.  In 2003 an Ilyushin-76 troop carrier crashed in southeast Iran killing all 276 Revolutionary Guard soldiers and crew.  A deal with world powers on Tehrans nuclear programme in 2015 opened the way for Iranian airlines to update their fleets but many older planes are still in service particularly on domestic routes. ,TRANSPORT_HAZARDS,1,

It is the largest earthquake to hit Bay Area since the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 In Napa 89 people have been injured of which 3 are serious.  Fortunetly no deaths have been reported so far. 69000 people have also been left without power.  The earthquake has caused significant damage in Napa and American Canyon.  Bridges and roads have been damaged including a bridge in American Canyon which has been closed due to the damage sustained.  Several historical buildings in Napa have been severaly damaged which includes the City Hall and two commercial buildings.  Fires caused by the earthquakes destroyed four mobile homes.  According to reports there were approximatley 50 gas main breaks and 60 leaks from damaged water mains.  The earthquake was caused by the San Andreas fault system which is where the Pacific is moving northwest in relation to the North American plate.  This movement causes a right lateral slip across the faults.  According to the USGS the location of the earthquake was near the West Napa Fault which is located between two major strike slip fault systems the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault system on the west and the Concord-Green Valley Fault system on the east.  As assessments are carried out the extent and severity of the damage will become clear over the next few hours or days.

Since the beginning of January 2014 there had been an increase in both shallow and deep volcanogenic earthquakes along with an increase in water temperature at the crater lake leading to the alert level being raised to 3 out of 4 and a 5km restriction zone around the crater.  Approximately 90 minutes before the alert was raised to 4 the volcano erupted resulting in the explosion being heard 125 miles 200 km away and an ash column reaching 30 km into the atmosphere.  Over 200000 people in 36 villages located 6 miles 10 km from the volcano were advised to evacuate immediately. 3 international airports in Surabaya Solo and Yogyakarta have also been shut down due to the widespread ash which has been reported to be up to 5 cm thick.  Towns and cities as far away as 80 miles 130 km away have experienced ash falls up to 5 cm thick.  The ash fall also caused roofs to collapse under the weight of the ash leading to the 2 reported deaths.  Just a few centimetres of ash can cause roofs to collapse especially poorly constructed ones made of weak material.  Kelut also known as Kelud is a 1731 metres stratovolcano located on the island of Java.  Eruptions have dated back to 230 BCE and the volcano has had episodes of eruptions as large as a VEI 4 since then.  A VEI 4 eruption in 1919 lead to the death of over 5000 people and another VEI 4 eruption in February 1990 lead to the death of more than 30 people. ,VOLCANO,1,

Approximately 90 minutes before the alert was raised to 4 the volcano erupted resulting in the explosion being heard 125 miles 200 km away and an ash column reaching 30 km into the atmosphere.  Over 200000 people in 36 villages located 6 miles 10 km from the volcano were advised to evacuate immediately. 3 international airports in Surabaya Solo and Yogyakarta have also been shut down due to the widespread ash which has been reported to be up to 5 cm thick.  Towns and cities as far away as 80 miles 130 km away have experienced ash falls up to 5 cm thick.  The ash fall also caused roofs to collapse under the weight of the ash leading to the 2 reported deaths.

Pieces of flesh and blood were strewn all around.  The bus was mangled beyond recognition.  It was a very sad sight a teacher who was present at the accident spot told mediapersons.  A mother who lost her child in the terrible tragedy said the bus left her house only 10 minutes earlier.  It was the last goodbye by my child she said amidst tears while recalling the tata waving of hand as a gesture of goodbye of her son.  Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao Andhra Pradeshs chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and YSRCP leader YS Jaganmohan Reddy expressed shock over the incident.  A probe has been ordered.

So far the north and east of the country have borne the brunt of the snow but now the arrival of CYCLONE Emma will bring the white stuff to millions more of us on [TIME-ARG] Friday [TIME-ARG],, UK braced for CYCLONE Emma as heavy snow causes chaos. content:London February 28 A brutal winter blast named Beast from the East after the direction of the winds is set to transform into CYCLONE Emma as the UK suffers severe travel disruptions and chaos due to heavy snow.  The Meteorological Office issued a rare red warning which indicates danger to life in Scotland after a second day of heavy snow today.  Several trains and flights have faced cancellations and delays since the start of this week as airports around the country suspend operations to clear the snow from runways.  “We are expecting quite wide impacts from CYCLONE Emma when she arrives tomorrow night.  We are forecasting more snow strong winds and freezing rain which will make driving conditions extremely dangerous” a Met Office spokesperson said.  Amber warnings calling for people to be wary are in place in northern and eastern England and the East Midlands with a number of police forces warning against driving because of poor visibility and treacherous conditions leading to crashes and stranded motorists.  Four people are believed to have died in road crashes directly linked to the severe weather conditions across Britain.  “The Beast from the East will tighten its grip as the week goes on.  Gale-force winds and super-cooled freezing rain could turn parts of the UK into an ice rink by the weekend” said Sara Thornton director of digital weather service Weathertrending.  “So far the north and east of the country have borne the brunt of the snow but now the arrival of CYCLONE Emma will bring the white stuff to millions more of us on Friday.  Gales will come with the snow bringing blizzard conditions to some southern and western parts of the UK that have so far been spared the snow” she said.  The snow has forced the closure of hundreds of schools across the UK after overnight temperatures dropped to almost -12 degrees Celsius in some areas.  There are fears that some rural communities could be cut off as power cuts and mobile phone network interruptions are expected.  The army has been drafted into Lincolnshire to help emergency services who have stepped up their official response to “critical”.  There are fears that one of this winters longest big freezes in the UK could result in the highest death toll for 20 years. — PTI. ,STORM,0,

MOGADISHU: Two car bombings killed 38 people in the Somali capital Mogadishu on Friday the citys main ambulance service told AFP on Saturday.  We have seen at least 38 people dead said Abdukadir Abdurahman Aden of the Aamin Ambulance of the bombings that targeted the presidential palace and a hotel.  The first blast followed by gunfire occurred at a security checkpoint close to Villa Somalia the name for the seat of government while a second followed soon after at a hotel according to police.  The Shabaab Islamist militant group claimed the attacks in a statement posted online saying it was targeting the government and security services.  The blasts follow weeks of relative calm in Mogadishu.  According to officials the main attack involved the use of a vehicle loaded with explosives attempting to breach a checkpoint leading to the presidential palace but security forces prevented the assault.  The security forces foiled the intent of the terrorists.  They were aiming for key targets but they could not even go closer there were five of them killed by the security force said Abdulahi Ahmed a security officer.  The Shabaab is fighting to overthrow Somalias internationally-backed government.  In October it carried out its deadliest-ever bombing killing over 500 people.  In the wake of that attack Somalias government declared a fresh offensive against the group and US drone strikes have increased in frequency.  While the militant group was pushed out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force it continues to control large parts of the countryside and launches regular attacks on government military and civilian targets. ,TERRORIST_ATTACK,0,

The blasts follow weeks of relative calm in Mogadishu.  According to officials the main attack involved the use of a vehicle loaded with explosives attempting to breach a checkpoint leading to the presidential palace but security forces prevented the assault.  The security forces foiled the intent of the terrorists.  They were aiming for key targets but they could not even go closer there were five of them killed by the security force said Abdulahi Ahmed a security officer.  The Shabaab is fighting to overthrow Somalias internationally-backed government.  In October it carried out its deadliest-ever bombing killing over 500 people.  In the wake of that attack Somalias government declared a fresh offensive against the group and US drone strikes have increased in frequency.  While the militant group was pushed out of the capital in 2011 by an African Union force it continues to control large parts of the countryside and launches regular attacks on government military and civilian targets. ,TERRORIST_ATTACK,0,

Fires on the tourist island of Madeira in August [CASUALTIES-ARG] killed three people [CASUALTIES-ARG]  while over the course of 2016 around 40 homes were destroyed and 5400 hectares of land burned,,Portugal forest fire: At least 24 killed most of them burned in their cars. A huge forest fire in central Portugal killed at least 24 people and injured 20 others most of them burning to death in their cars the government said. Around 500 firefighters and 160 vehicles were dispatched to tackle the blaze which broke out on Saturday afternoon in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande before spreading. “What we are seeing is a great tragedy. For the moment 24 deaths are confirmed but the number of fatalities could still rise” Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at the Civil Protection headquarters near Lisbon. “The priority now is to get the ongoing fire under control -- after that we must understand what happened” he said. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes earlier said all 19 of the people then confirmed dead were civilians. “Three of them died from smoke inhalation and 16 burned to death in their cars when they found themselves trapped by flames on the road from Figueiro dos Vinhos to Castanheira de Pera” Gomes told journalists. Fourteen civilians were injured 10 of them seriously along with six firefighters he added. The flames spread “with great violence” moving out on four fronts he said. Several villages were affected by the blaze but Gomes was not immediately able to comment on the extent of the damage caused. President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet families of the victims “sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people” he said.

Several militant attacks followed culminating in a December Taliban massacre at [PLACE-ARG] a school in Peshawar [PLACE-ARG]  that killed 134 children and 19 adults,,Six killed in Lahore bombing. A Taliban suicide bomber today killed six persons and himself in a brazen attack on police headquarters in Lahore. According to the militants the attack was a revenge bid for the recent hangings of colleagues. It was the third in a series of high-profile attacks in the last month triggered by a government decision in December to begin hanging those convicted of terror attacks reversing an informal six-year moratorium on the death penalty. We claim the attack in Lahore because the government is killing our men in prison said Ehsanullah Ehsan a spokesman for powerful Taliban splinter group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. We will get revenge for every man and our struggle will continue until sharia is instituted in the country he said referring to Islamic law. Punjab police chief Mushtaq Sukhera said a policeman and four civilians were among the dead. Jam Hussain a spokesman for the emergency services said six bodies had been recovered along with the attackers. At least 23 people were injured said Khawaja Salman Rafique health adviser to the chief minister of Punjab. Casualties would have been much greater if the police had not been alert and kept out the bomber Lahore police chief Amin Wains told reporters at the attack site. It was a suicide blast the bomber blew up prematurely outside the police offices he added. That he could not enter the offices shows our security was successful. Ali Raza the owner of a shop nearby said the blast had been powerful enough to knock over one of his employees and left body parts strewn in the street. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to hold peace talks with the Taliban after he came to power in elections in 2012 But the talks failed and last June the military launched an offensive to drive the Taliban from their stronghold.

Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes earlier said all 19 of the people then confirmed dead were civilians. “Three of them died from smoke inhalation and 16 burned to death in their cars when they found themselves trapped by flames on the road from Figueiro dos Vinhos to Castanheira de Pera” Gomes told journalists. Fourteen civilians were injured 10 of them seriously along with six firefighters he added. The flames spread “with great violence” moving out on four fronts he said. Several villages were affected by the blaze but Gomes was not immediately able to comment on the extent of the damage caused. President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet families of the victims “sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people” he said.

Around 500 firefighters and 160 vehicles were dispatched to tackle the blaze which broke out on Saturday afternoon in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande before spreading. “What we are seeing is a great tragedy. For the moment 24 deaths are confirmed but the number of fatalities could still rise” Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at the Civil Protection headquarters near Lisbon. “The priority now is to get the ongoing fire under control -- after that we must understand what happened” he said. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes earlier said all 19 of the people then confirmed dead were civilians. “Three of them died from smoke inhalation and 16 burned to death in their cars when they found themselves trapped by flames on the road from Figueiro dos Vinhos to Castanheira de Pera” Gomes told journalists. Fourteen civilians were injured 10 of them seriously along with six firefighters he added. The flames spread “with great violence” moving out on four fronts he said. Several villages were affected by the blaze but Gomes was not immediately able to comment on the extent of the damage caused. President Marcelo Rebelo went to the Leiria region to meet families of the victims “sharing their pain in the name of all the Portuguese people” he said. Firefighters did “all they could” when faced with the blaze he added. Portugal was sweltering under a severe heatwave Saturday with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in several regions. The country was hit by a series of fires last year which devastated more than 1000 square km of the mainland. Fires on the tourist island of Madeira in August killed three people while over the course of 2016 around 40 homes were destroyed and 5400 hectares of land burned. ,FIRE,0,

I was sleeping when the crash happened. I thought it was an air strike. When I opened my eyes there was blood everywhere a hospitalised passenger told state television. State television footage showed four derailed carriages two of them on fire and a spokesman for Irans Red Crescent Mostafa Mortazavi told the semi-official Fars news agency that firefighters were trying to control the blaze. Senior health ministry official later announced via Tasnim news agency that rescue operations had been completed and the final death toll was 44 An investigation into the cause of the crash in the northern province of Semnan was continuing. Semnan provincial governor Mohammad Reza Khabbaz told Iranian television it appeared that a train entering the Haft-Khan station on the outskirts of Shahroud ploughed into another that had broken down there. The initial investigation suggests that a mechanical failure possibly caused by cold weather forced the express train operating between the cities of Tabriz and Mashhad to stop at Haft-Khan Khabbaz said. Tabriz state governor Rahim Shohratifar told Tasnim that the moving train had 400 passengers. It was not clear how many passengers were on the stationary train. Fars earlier reported that 100 passengers had been rescued. Semi-official Mehr news agency said four of the dead were railway employees aboard the trains. Irans rail network aged badly under economic sanctions imposed over its disputed nuclear programme making it difficult to modernise rolling stock and safety standards suffered.
